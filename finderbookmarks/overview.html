<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Finder Bookmarks is an editor for Web Location
Files, the browser-independent bookmarks that you can
store anywhere on your Macintosh.</p>
<p>You will find that organizing your bookmarks in the Finder, with the
help of this software, is easier and more powerful than organizing them
in any web browser. If you're working on a research project, why not
store your notes, pictures, web locations, and working draft all in one
place?

<h2>Functionality the Finder
forgot</h2>
<p>Although Web Location Files
have been around since Mac OS 8, the
Finder's support of them has always been spotty. In Mac OS X, there is
no way to edit the URL of a location once it has been created. And
although web browsers do a good job of opening and creating these
files, they too have forgotten to let you edit them. This application
fills the gap.

<h2>Web site icons</h2>
<p>In addition
to meeting the basic need to maintain location addresses, this
application will help you distinguish your location files by attaching
the web site's icon, if one is available.

<h1>Safari Bookmarks Import</h1>
</font></font></div>
<font><font face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">In order to get you
started using Finder Bookmarks, the import feature
copies all of your existing Safari bookmarks to a folder on your
desktop. This spares you the onerous task of manually making a Web
Location File for each one.<br>

<h2>Dynamic Locations
</h2>
<font><font face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Not only can you work
with standard Web Locations in Finder
Bookmarks, you can make a new kind of location that doesn't point to
any specific web page. Dynamic Locations contain parameters that you
fill in
every time you use them. These parameters could be anything from Google
search terms to amounts of currencies you wish to convert.</font></font>

<h2>Faster, better searching
</h2>
<font face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
<p><font><font face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Using Dynamic
Locations is fast because you bypass the front page of a site. And
since Dynamic Location fill-in windows are much smaller than the front
page of a Web site, you can leave them open indefinitely. </font></font></p>
<p><font><font face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Though some Web
browsers have built-in search functionality, it is often limited to a
specific site. Safari, for example, only searches Google. Even when
this feature is more flexible, your
search bookmarks are limited to one browser and cannot be
exported. Only with Finder Bookmarks can you collect a library of
Dynamic Locations that will always work with your default browser. </font></font></p>
<p><font><font face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">To help get you
started, a collection of Dynamic Locations comes with Finder Bookmarks.
