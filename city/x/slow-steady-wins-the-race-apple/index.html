	<p>I like to post <a href="../../../doc/articles/2005/10/06/apple-no-more-things-please.html">occasionally</a> about the folly of buying products from Apple immediately upon their introduction. Having purchased a <a href="http://doctorbarnett.blogspot.com/2005/09/imac-busted-again.html">$2000+ iMac</a> with MrLittlePants almost two years ago that is a <acronym title="Piece of Shit. Duh.">POS</acronym>, it&#8217;s become my own little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_are_the_World">celebrity crusade</a>.</p>


	<p>If Apple is more guilty than other computer manufacturers of rushing unfinished products to market, it might have something to do with them being the only computer manufacturer to engage in &#8220;industrial design.&#8221; You know, making things look cool. I&#8217;m all for that, but considering the premium price of Apple products, it&#8217;s plain nasty to burn your best, most enthusiastic customers.</p>


	<p>So, for the Apple faithful who&#8217;d rather not lose that faith, I&#8217;ve got another whip for the self-flagellation closet: the <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/readerreports/">MacInTouch Reader Reports</a>. MacInTouch itself is a little cheesed-out on Apple, but they do the world a tremendous service (and show a little gumption) in hosting a neutral, moderated forum on Apple hardware.</p>


	<p>Do you think the MacBook Pro is a sweet notebook? Have you read a couple of good reviews, and envied the people who got in on the first shipment? <strong>Well, stop it.</strong> Skim through <a href="http://www.macintouch.com/readerreports/macbookpro/index.html">the reports</a> to get an idea of the first round of MacIntel notebooks:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p><em>Marian Petrides, M.D.</em> I&#8217;m now on my third <span class="caps">MBP</span> (2.0 GHz), the first two (both <span class="caps">SN W8612</span> ) having been returned due to the screen whine&#8212;the one that reportedly is the result of a defective screen inverter.[&#8230;]</p>
	</blockquote>


	<blockquote>
		<p>My conclusion: I will probably keep this machine since it is otherwise just fine, I almost always work with my machine plugged into the wall [&#8230;]</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>A notebook, plugged in? I&#8217;d get a second opinion, Doc.</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p><em>Ben Shapiro</em> I&#8217;m now on my third MacBook pro. The first (W8611&#8230;) went in for service due to <span class="caps">LOTS</span> of heat, the whine, and occasional crashiness. After having it for repair for a while, Apple let me know the repair was delayed because they were waiting on a part. [&#8230;]</p>
	</blockquote>


	<blockquote>
		<p>The second machine (W8612&#8230;) had issues with the screen backlight. I had intermittent problems with waking from sleep [&#8230;] but nothing could make the backlight turn on, other than putting it to sleep and waking it back up.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<blockquote>
		<p>I got the third machine today (W8613) at the Michigan Avenue Apple Store. Hopefully this one will have no functional issues.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Yes, Ben. Hopefully.</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p><em>Daniel Griscom</em> The big noise is the <span class="caps">DVD</span> drive. [&#8230;] its internal motors makes this strange &#8220;whoop&#8230; whoopwhoop&#8230; wheedlieoodoowopwow&#8230; wheedlieoodoowopwow&#8230; wheedlieoodoowup&#8221; noise.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<blockquote>
		<p>My guess is that it&#8217;s trying to figure out if anyone inserted a <span class="caps">DVD</span> since it last had power. Annoying, but of limited duration.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Nice computer, man! <em>Whoop!</em></p>


	<p>I&#8217;m drawing attention to this for several reasons. Firstly, I don&#8217;t want anyone I know to get burned by new Apple hardware. So the rule is as follows: <em>don&#8217;t</em> preorder, and <em>don&#8217;t</em> buy until substantive reader reports appear at MacInTouch. Chances are, there will be enough bad news there to spook you until the usually excellent &#8220;Rev. B&#8221; comes out.</p>


	<p>The other reason is, ultimately, Apple&#8217;s hardware rush-to-market is harming the company. Bad apples snuff out the enthusiasm of fans like me and MrLittlePants, and they turn fresh recruits into permanent enemies. Let&#8217;s see what we have here&#8230;</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p><em>Ron Day</em> This is my first, and will be my last, purchase from Apple. This machine is totally unacceptable, especially given the price. I&#8217;ve owned four different laptops in the past 8 years (two Dells and two Gateways) and had nothing like the problems of this machine. For the price of this machine I could have bought two (and even three, reconditioned) PC laptops.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Ouch!</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p><em>MacInTouch Reader</em> I am only a week new to Apple. So far I am not pleased. My Macbook pro is having some very odd issues. For starters my optical drive is dead. I can&#8217;t load any disc of any kind. Nothing happens, push the disc all the way and it won&#8217;t grab it. Sometimes when I boot up, it won&#8217;t read the <span class="caps">OSX</span>, [ed: <em>the</em> OSX&#8212;how cute!] it just sits at the gray screen for a few minutes then a folder with a question mark will show up in the middle of the screen. [ed: <em>not</em> cute]</p>
	</blockquote>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Oh and when things do finally work and are working for about a hour or so, the machine starts to heat up so intensly that I think it could start a fire. Or the beach ball will start spinning again, and I am not able to click on anything again. [&#8230;]</p>
	</blockquote>


	<blockquote>
		<p>I am not happy so far with this so called solid Apple hardware. I am thinking of getting it replaced for a Acer Ferarri.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Apple, <a href="http://global.acer.com/products/notebook/fr3000.htm">look</a> at what you are forcing people in to. <a href="http://www.ep.tc/stopthemadness/">Stop the madness.</a></p>


	<p><strong>Update:</strong> I&#8217;m going to start piling on highish-profile problem reports here:</p>

<p>As an aside, when we were visiting University of Nebraska, the coordinator for the dept in which we&#8217;d be studying was using an &#8220;Acer Ferarri&#8221;. He was obviously pretty proud of his &#8220;high performance laptop&#8221;, which just made me want to throw up even more.</p>

<p>In any case, I think it&#8217;s safe to say we&#8217;ll be attending the Monterey Institute.</p></div>
