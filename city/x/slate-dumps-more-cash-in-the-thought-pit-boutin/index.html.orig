	<blockquote>
		<p>A month ago, I said Steve Jobs had no plans to unveil an iTV—the hypothetical iTunes video gadget for big-screen TVs. Wrong! This week His Steveness invited me to the iTV demo at Apple&#8217;s Tuesday press event in San Francisco.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>It&#8217;s interesting that &#8220;His Steveness&#8221; (a nickname so clever it had already been used <a href="http://www.neon.de/kat/kaufen/elektronik/5937.html">in German two years ago</a>) would bother to invite the writer of <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2147258/">Why you don&#8217;t have an Apple iTV</a> to the iTV unveiling.</p>


	<p>It makes me think there might be something to <a href="/doc/articles/2006/09/12/watch-out-slate-its-the-apple-itv">my crackpot theory</a> that the temporary name &#8220;iTV,&#8221; and perhaps even its early announcement, are a jab at Paul&#8217;s uninformed article. (Yeah, that would be unreasonable and stupid, but we are talking about “His Steveness.” He does shit like that.) On the other hand, that &#8220;me&#8221; might be an ego-inflating abbreviation of &#8220;<a href="http://paulboutin.weblogger.com/2006/09/12#a1574">Engadget for whom I transcribe</a>,&#8221; but that&#8217;s more boring for everyone.</p>


	<p><img src="/pictures/iTV-back.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Boutin wastes little time apologizing and gets right to criticizing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_iTV">newly announced product</a>. Gone is his hand-wringing over the &#8220;10-foot interface,&#8221; which the iTV addresses neatly with its Apple remote and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Row-type">Front Row</a> interface (first shown almost a year ago, and included with most new Macs). Now it&#8217;s all about how the iTV won&#8217;t be a TiVo.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m a little surprised about the lack of a coax-in too, but it&#8217;s not inspiring me to write a piece condemning the unfinished product to failure. The problem with cable is that cable companies are greedy bitches. They&#8217;re in the middle of tearing apart TiVo by incorporating TiVo&#8217;s original ideas into their own boxes, which are the only ones that can decrypt premium content digital signals. (This is probably why the new <a href="http://www.elgato.com/index.php?file=products_eyetvhybridna">EyeTV Hybrid</a> doesn&#8217;t even bother with digital cable.)</p>


	<p>Apple could either beg cable companies to cooperate (have you ever seen Apple beg?), tell people to use broadcast (that would only work on techno-hippies like me), or flank the cable companies by delivering content over the Internet. So they took plan C, as they did with music. If you think about it, it&#8217;s not really that surprising.</p>


	<p>Boutin goes after the <em>present</em> quality of iTunes video downloads, which is inferior to <span class="caps">HDTV</span> (and even <span class="caps">DVD</span>, if the <span class="caps">DVD</span> is well mastered). This is true, but&#8230;</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Séan Captain recently explained in Slate, by the time the video quality of downloads catches up to <span class="caps">HDTV</span>, there&#8217;ll already be a higher-definition replacement for it.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>..that isn&#8217;t. (Do all of these jokers have French-looking names?) What Sayan <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2140930/">really said</a>:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>And don&#8217;t just assume that the Web will catch up in a year or two. While Internet bandwidth and video quality will improve, so will our standards. There&#8217;s already talk of increasing the color gamut and resolution of <span class="caps">HDTV</span>. Television quality is a moving target that the Internet already fails to hit.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>They&#8217;re both wrong, but at least Sayan says &#8220;don&#8217;t assume B&#8221; and dodges assuming A. From everyone who was paying attention&#8217;s perspective, it took <strong>forever</strong> to get <span class="caps">HDTV</span> in the U.S. It was in Japan in, like, the 60s or something. Calling television a &#8220;moving target&#8221; that the Internet can&#8217;t keep up with is just hilariously ignorant. The Internet is famous for making laps around technologies controlled by governments or slow-moving corporations&#8212;TV has both of those weighing it down.</p>


	<p>Furthermore, Boutin&#8217;s wildly overreaching summary is wrong in the present. Apple has been offering HD-quality &#8220;downloads&#8221; of movie trailers since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicktime#QuickTime_7.x">April 2005 introduction of QuickTime 7</a>. Surpassing <span class="caps">HDTV</span> is just a matter of adjusting compression settings, and delivering it in quantity is just a matter of bandwidth. Ever hear of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_FiOS">FiOS</a>? (Really, he should have run this piece by those &#8220;tech-savvy friends&#8221; at <em>Engadget</em>.)</p>


	<p>If the cable companies have any sense, they&#8217;re pissing their pants right now. Soon they&#8217;ll be in the same position as record stores, watching Apple sucking away the business in a way they hadn&#8217;t imagined. Software moves faster than hardware. The Internet is faster than the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvVp7b5gzqU">sleeping cable guy</a>. And Apple is good at exploiting these advantages.</p>


	<p>Boutin is, apparently, good at being assigned pieces he is wholly unqualified to write. He&#8217;s become a <a href="http://news.com.com/Apples+iPod+spurs+mixed+reactions/2100-1040_3-274821.html"><span class="caps">CNET</span>-style</a> uninformed Apple skeptic. If he were writing for them, we wouldn&#8217;t have to be bothered with his existence. But what the hell is <em>Slate</em> thinking? Their <em>Technology</em> column has never been good, and now it&#8217;s descending into incoherent, offensively clueless jabs.</p>


	<p>The headline was &#8220;Will Apple Change Television Forever? Not now. Maybe never.&#8221; This beautiful disaster  accidentally comes close to the truth. &#8220;Not now&#8221; (it&#8217;s unreleased) and &#8220;maybe never&#8221; (yes, you <em>never know</em>) are throwaway, but the part about changing television is dead on. Shifting to a download-at-will vs. broadcast model <em>would</em> &#8220;change television forever.&#8221; Just copying TiVo <em>would not</em> &#8220;change television forever,&#8221; as TiVo started in 1997 and you can&#8217;t &#8220;change television forever&#8221; in the same way twice.</p>


	<p>Great insight <em>Slate</em>, it&#8217;s just exactly backwards.</p>
