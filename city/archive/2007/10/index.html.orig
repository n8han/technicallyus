Traffic police used to be happy to scribble down any old zany explanation for crashes given by auto drivers (who miraculously survive their collisions with bicycles and bodies about 100% of the time) so everybody could go home and just forget about it. But pesky <em>Streetsblog</em> is investigating pretty much every death now, as if those lives had value, and finding that trivial details like if somebody was biking in the wrong direction <a href='http://www.streetsblog.org/2007/10/19/details-emerge-in-brooklyn-cyclist-deaths/'>totally don&#8217;t add up</a>.
