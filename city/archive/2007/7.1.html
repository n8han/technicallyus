Here&#8217;s a gem: &#8220;We have over 30 of these &#8230; and all have failed with either bulging capacitors, bad power supply, or both.&#8221; That is not okay. Neither was last year&#8217;s <a href='../../../doc/articles/2006/05/07/slow-steady-wins-the-race-apple.html'>rickety MacBook Pro debut</a>, and excusing it with, &#8220;Compared to enterprise Dell products&#8230;&#8221; is pretty sad, <em>Roughly</em>.</p></div>

It&#8217;s gross when Hawley or his ghost writer tries to sound all bloggy, as in, &#8220;things that can do catastrophic harm (bombs!),&#8221; but it&#8217;s worth it watch him run from Schneier in public. His tactic now seems to be endorsing anti-<abbr>TSA</abbr> arguments while claiming those are, in fact, their own secret positions. The old up-is-down defense.</p></div>
