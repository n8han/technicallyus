We thought we had won the war against church ladies back in 1933, but those clever bats foresaw that <em>the automobile</em> was an engine of alcoholic abstinence. For the next half century everybody stupidly decided to live at least three miles from his friends, and from daily necessities, so that driving became as American as bathing. Then in 1980 the other clog dropped with the founding of Ladies Against Drunk Driving. After 27 years of their heart-wrenching and politically deadly ad spots, we can relax knowing that when we&#8217;re torn asunder by a civilian tank its operator probably made the boo-boo in holy sobriety. But guess what, Bessie! Drinkers will not be subdued so easily. Now they&#8217;re <a href='http://www.boingboing.net/2007/09/04/housing-development.html'>building burbs for boozing</a>.

Anyway, it appears to be one of those <strong>series reboot</strong> things. Now the show is all about how &#8220;six families&#8221; have always controlled the country, with the puppet strings. (It used to be about Army Special Forces.) So we can expect to find out who was really behind 9/11, the Kennedys, etc. So much for the unfamiliar patriotic kick we got out of <em>The</em> old <em>Unit</em>.</p></div>
