		<div><p>I made a little progress this week in my <a href="http://technically.us/n8/articles/2005/10/10/i-promise-not-to-call-it-phoenix">play project</a> that aims to do something interesting with <a href="http://www.freedb.org/">freedb</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>.</p>


	<p>So I was <em>just</em> thinking, as I threw together a simple webapp in 30 minutes last night, how easy it would be to rewrite the the user facing side of my  work&#8217;s Web site (the read only pages, anyway) in Rails. It would be <strong>cake</strong>. I&#8217;m cheerfully working on rewriting much of our administration site in <a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net/">Wicket</a>, enjoying all the benefits of a component programming, but also seeing how inappropriate its heavy-duty abstraction is for simple content display. The session overhead is excessive for a high volume site, and the <span class="caps">URL</span> issues will <strong>never</strong> be solved. (The <span class="caps">URL</span> can&#8217;t contain all the information needed to render a page when most of your state is on the server.)</p>


	<p>Then today I came across <a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2005/11/16/ruby-the-rival.html">this O&#8217;Reilly article</a> trying to make sense of the whole Rails disruption. James Duncan Davidson&#8217;s comments resonated the most with me:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>And I think that&#8217;s the real win from the recent attention on Ruby on Rails and the breakaway from viewing the world with Java-colored glasses. It&#8217;s not that Ruby on Rails is going to be the next Java. Far from it. It&#8217;s that Ruby on Rails helps to break this idea that there is &#8220;One True Way.&#8221; There&#8217;s not. There are many different ways to solve a problem. And really, none of them is the clear-cut winner. There&#8217;s just places where one solution has advantages.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>Indeed, that&#8217;s the Java dogmatism that has driven me to <a href="http://technically.us/n8/pages/tier">rail against tiers</a>. So, I like this guy, but here&#8217;s where I disagree:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>The strengths of Java could be applied to a brand new framework in interesting and amazing ways. It&#8217;s just that nobody has done that yet.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>I think Wicket <em>is</em> that framework, the one that takes advantage of Java&#8217;s strengths and makes all the cartwheels we have to turn for the language worthwhile. Web components that render themselves, profit from inheritence, and don&#8217;t die at the end of the request cycle are done brilliantly in Wicket. Maybe Davidson just hasn&#8217;t tried it yet.</p>


	<p>So where does this all lead? The O&#8217;Reilly panel mostly dodges the question, or maintains that &#8220;the enterprise&#8221; will still be better off with Java. Some answer! It&#8217;s not the size of the company that determines the best technology to use&#8212;it&#8217;s the application you&#8217;re building. Use Ruby for one and Java for another. (If Java programmers could drop their fetish for &#8220;e,&#8221; they might be able to think more clearly.)</p>


	<p>For high volume sites with working URLs, you need a <em>stateless framework</em>. Java has always been a bad choice for a stateless framework (<a href="http://struts.apache.org/">Struts</a>, please die) because there&#8217;s little payoff for the object palace you&#8217;re required to build your apps in. In days past the best bet was <span class="caps">PHP</span>, but Ruby on Rails is the clear winner now: it&#8217;s practical object orientation.</p>


	<p>On the other hand, if you&#8217;re supporting a limited number of users in a fairly complicated system that you want to work like a desktop application, then you can benefit from  a <em>stateful framework</em>. Go ahead pour a few hours into this or that component, because it won&#8217;t have packed up and left you 1, 2, or 3 requests later. Java + Wicket is the best thing going in this department.</p>


	<p>Two classes of frameworks, and two front-runners. You can learn both, or you can just be a fanboy.</p></div>

<p>State reduction in Wicket is a matter of adding effort (inasmuch as you care to reduce state):</p>

<ol>
<li>make your models detachable</li>

<li>make your pages bookmarkable (and therefore often stateless) where possible</li>

<li>implement custom IPageMapEntrys to reduce size of page state in session</li>

<li>we can actually implement client side state fairly easily. and with cystom IPageMapEntry implementaions, that state could be made efficient.</li>

  			<div id="item-1052"><p>Yes, I&#8217;m aware of efforts to make bookmarkable URLs more palatable. It&#8217;s a great thing that in Wicket 1.2, we&#8217;ll be able to (easily) have, e.g. /weblog/article/2342 like rails instead of the current /weblog?bookmarkablePage=com.whoever.Article&amp;id=2342 .</p>

<p>That&#8217;s nice for bookmarkable actions, but the more you depend on that, the less you benefit from Wicket&#8217;s statefulness, right? There&#8217;s all sorts of information on the server (or client) about my current application state that isn&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t be coded into the URL.</p>

<p>So the &#8220;URL issue&#8221; that I see is that in standard use, a Wicket application presents the user with URLs that can&#8217;t be reused (path=x). I don&#8217;t think there will be a solution to that, and I think that&#8217;s fine for a lot of apps, but not, obviously, some amazon.com.</p>

<p>I suppose one <em>could</em> code up a Wicket application that&#8217;s hybrid: in the amazon example you would keep all links bookmarkable until you started to make a purchase, at which point it doesn&#8217;t matter so much. That would also correspond with the point where things get more complicated (checkout wizards have foiled many a Web programmer) and would benefit from statefulness.</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s be realistic. For a Web site that isn&#8217;t very interactive, and whose URLs need be stable, there is no point in using Wicket with only bookmarkable pages. You&#8217;re just better off with scripting.</p></div>
