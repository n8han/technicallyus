		<div><p>I had my first experience cooking in front of a camera tonight. I was contacted recently by a television producer, and I agreed to be taped making meatloaf for a video project. I don&#8217;t know exactly where it will end up, but I will certainly link to it if possible.</p>


	<p>Of course the whole thing made me pretty nervous, but not as nervous as I expected to be. I asked an acquaintance who has been on TV many times for advice, and she told me to wear a solid color other than white and to relax and be myself. So I kept reminding myself how easy <a href="http://technically.us/eat/articles/2006/04/03/leland-tackles-meatloaf">meatloaf</a> is, and how little there is to screw up. My main concern was looking dumb on camera, and for all I know, I did. But I had a glass of wine before the producers arrived, and I had my ingredients in place, so I felt good.</p>


	<p>The hardest thing about being taped while you cook is having to talk about what you&#8217;re doing. When I cook on a regular night, Nathan is working on the computer a few feet away, and we&#8217;re either chatting or just listening to music. I&#8217;m certainly not narrating my progress. But I think I did alright once I got into it.</p>


	<p>The loaf, incidentally, came out beautifully. It didn&#8217;t fall apart, and the flavor was good enough for the producers to have seconds. If I had known that the final plating was to be recorded, and that they were going to stay and eat, I would have made a green side dish like spinach or green beans or at least a small salad. As it was, we just had roasted yams and garlic, so I thought it all looked a bit sad on the plate. But at that point there was nothing to be done. I told the guys that my mom would be horrified by the lack of a green vegetable. Sure enough, when I told her about it on the phone, she asked, &#8220;What? Nothing green?&#8221;</p>


	<p>Another snafu was that I started to cry uncontrollably in the middle of chopping the onion. Off camera, I can take a break and run some water near my eyes. I&#8217;m just glad I didn&#8217;t chop a finger off trying to look smooth. I hope that scene gets cut!</p></div>

<p>Sounds like it was a big success.</p></div>

<p>Great opportunity. If you get the chance link to the video so we can all witness the making of a future tv chef!</p>

Why not videotape your nightly dishes and add them to your blog or create a video cookbook of video clips that could be searched by topic such as meatloaf&#8212;then we could follow your visual directions on cooking!</p></div>

Baby!  Can&#8217;t wait to see it also.  I have been told that if you hold a chunk of bread in your mouth, sticking out, it keeps you from crying while doing onions.  Of course you would have a hard time narrating in that case!  How about some sports goggles??  I am very proud of you.</p></div>
