		<div><p>Mark Bittman has a nice <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/dining/25mini.html?_r=1&#38;ref=dining&#38;oref=slogin">piece</a> on salad dressing in this week&#8217;s dining section. He writes off most bottled dressings and insists that &#8220;taking two minutes to combine extra virgin olive oil, vinegar and a couple of real seasonings is an enlightening experience, one that can make you vow to leave the mass-produced concoctions of cheap oil, water (more water than oil, if it’s low-fat), dried spices and hideously unnatural chemicals on the supermarket shelf.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t agree more.</p>


	<p>If someone opens a bag of lettuce and a few other bags of various salad toppings and teams it with a bottle of dressing, I&#8217;ll eat it and never think of it again. However, I&#8217;m always disappointed when someone has gone to some kind of trouble to wash lettuce or chop vegetables or cheese, all just to overshadow his work with a heavy pour from the oily bottle of Newman&#8217;s Own dressing that&#8217;s been in the refrigerator door for six months. Salad takes time and care, and I appreciate a beautiful homemade salad as much as the rest of the meal.</p>


	<p>Mom taught me to make salad dressing when I had my first kitchen several years ago. I had never tasted a bottled dressing at that time, so it wouldn&#8217;t have even occurred to me to buy one. My dressing is slightly different from hers, and she probably wouldn&#8217;t like it very much, as I prefer it strong with the taste of vinegar and mustard.</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;re eating salad every day or even twice a week, it&#8217;s worth getting in the habit of whisking yourself up a bit of dressing. As far as I can tell, you don&#8217;t even have to refrigerate it, although I do it out of habit. Adjust the flavorings to your own taste; it helps to mix it in a measuring cup or a dressing shaker, like this vintage Tupperware beauty that Uncle Ted gave me:</p>


	<p><img src="../../../../../pictures/dressingshaker.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>because you can keep an eye on how much vinegar you&#8217;re using and what you like. At this point, I do it in a bowl and know that I&#8217;m done when the dressing coats the side of the bowl in a certain way.</p>


	<p>For enough dressing for a big salad, start with 50 milliliters of balsamic vinegar (Mom prefers white, I prefer dark). Whisk in about a teaspoon of whole grain mustard and a bit of salt and pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice if you happen to have a cut lemon. Begin to pour in extra virgin olive oil while whisking. You&#8217;ll need at least 100 milliliters, but it will be to taste and according to your own preferences. Before serving, give it a final whisk to emulsify it well. A bit of garlic or shallot or soy sauce is nice, but keeping it simple is nice too.</p>


	<p>I <em>hate</em> pouring dressing on my own plate. If it&#8217;s at all possible, toss the dressing with the salad so that every (well-spun) leaf is lightly coated. All of this information is probably old-hat to most of Eat&#8217;s readers, but we&#8217;ve been in a 101 spirit recently. This is exactly the kind of information I needed years ago, and I&#8217;m sure someone, somewhere, will benefit from it.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-2961"><p>Good post, Leland! I&#8217;m always amazed at how many people are still putting bottles of dressing on the table. Even the better ones, like Newman&#8217;s, are made with ingredients you wouldn&#8217;t use at home, like soy oil.</p>
<p>I am thinking of switching to sherry vinegar after reading <a href="http://lobstersquad.blogspot.com/">Lobstersquad&#8217;s</a> ode to it recently and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be eating a lot of it next month in Spain, since I gather it&#8217;s that country&#8217;s version of balsamic.</p>
<p>One bone to pick with you regarding your post, though: what <strong>are</strong> milliliters, exactly, and why are you giving the recipe in them and not the more common English measurements that we use in this country? :)</p></div>

  			<div id="item-2962"><p>Thanks, Mom! Hmm, do you measure in cups? I have always used ml for salad dressing, because that&#8217;s what is on my shaker. Don&#8217;t all measuring cups have ml on them?</p>
<p>According to google, 50 ml = 0.21 US cups.</p>
<p>Sherry vinegar can be very delicate and delicious. Sounds like it would make a nice stocking stuffer for someone special.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-2963"><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about posting on salad dressing too &#8230;</p>
<p>I use a kind of scientific bottle (with ml, which I never use because its just 1:2, right?) with an orange plastic top which a friend lifted from her lab to complete her mad scientist Halloween costume and then no one felt comfortable returning it.</p>
<p>This is really quite strange because my parents have always used a scientific bottle (with a ground glass stopper) that <span class="caps">THEY</span> lifted from a science lab back in the day when ground glass stoppers were more the thing. If it had measures on it they had worn off by the time I was eating salad.</p>
<p>Anyway, 1:2, we used to make it with red wine vinegar, then later balsamic.  There was a brief period when my mom added a teaspoon of raspberry jelly, if it was around (this was when I was in college and taught my friends to make dressing and they appreciate it to this day).  Now she says she doesn&#8217;t remember doing this!</p>
<p>And one can add mustard and garlic and salt and pepper and whatever in the amounts one likes.</p>
<p>There were also times when my mom would add dried herbs.</p>
<p>Every now and then when I&#8217;ve made a big meal with lots of steps and then I realize I don&#8217;t have salad dressing I think about &#8220;getting out of the salad dressing business&#8221; but I&#8217;ve never found a bottled dressing I like.  Those not-creamy ginger ones are kind of nice, though.  But they don&#8217;t go with everything.</p>
<p>Between the applesauce and the salad dressing, you guys here at Eat sure bring out the &#8220;me and my mom&#8221; stories buried deep within me!</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m going to post a photo of dressing bottle at my flicr site. I love love love yours.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-2964"><p>You folks actually measure your ingredients, huh?</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I like to do with salad:</p>
<p>-I start with minced shallots, salt, and vinegar in a bowl and let the shallots sort of pickle for five minutes before I add more ingredients.  These five-minute shallots (without the added oil/mustard/herbs) are also a great condiment on hot dogs and hambugers.</p>
<p>-I mix the vinaigrette in the very same wood salad bowl where the lettuce will go after rubbing the bowl with a clove of smashed garlic, which I then discard.  If I am going to make only enough vinaigrette for one salad, I prefer to mix it in the bowl where the salad will go to make cleanup easier.</p>
<p>-Sometimes I make a creamy dressing with a little bit of commercial mayonnaise thinned with some combination of white wine vinegar, lemon juice, herbs (basil and tarragon are my favorites for this), buttermilk and/or garlic or shallots.  These go well on heartier greens like Romaine or iceberg (which I do love) but not so well on delicate leaf lettuces, arugula, etc.</p>
<p>There are some jarred dressings that are impossible to replicate yourself that I like to have on hand, esp. Kraft Thousand Island and Hidden Valley Ranch.  Not all store-bought dressing is bad, though of course the low-fat varieties are hardly edible at all.</p></div>

<p>Just like in the movies.</p>
<p>Specifically, I am thinking of some sort of French slapstick movie or slapstick movie set in France or maybe just a French restaurant . . . does anybody know the movie I&#8217;m talking about . . . ?  I think it is black and white . . . ?</p></div>

  			<div id="item-2969"><p>So many great ideas from you guys! Michael: I especially like your technique of rubbing the bowl with garlic. Maybe that&#8217;s finally the good way to add the aroma of garlic to a salad without overwhelming it.</p>
