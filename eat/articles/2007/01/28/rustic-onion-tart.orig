		<div><p>Let me start by saying that, while you experienced crust-makers are welcome to laugh at me in private over the sight of the crazy-looking tart down below, I am thrilled with my own success. I&#8217;ve tried crusts in the past, which I&#8217;m not linking to because they are so embarassing. Now that I finally have a <a href="http://technically.us/eat/articles/2007/01/16/a-food-processor">food processor</a>, crust is a thousand times easier, just as Mom promised.</p>


	<p><img src="/pictures/rustictart.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe how fast the cold butter was incorporated into the flour. It was less than ten seconds from chunky to cornmeal. I refrigerated it overnight (I got inspired to make the crust at one a.m.), and this morning I rolled it out and made the <a href="http://www.elise.com/recipes/archives/002135rustic_onion_tart.php">rustic onion tart</a> from Simply Recipes. The rolling was easy, and it would look a lot better if I hadn&#8217;t had the bright idea to roll it on a silicone mat. I thought that&#8217;s what silicone was good for, but my dough stuck to it like glue, and I had to do some scraping with clenched teeth and sweat on my brow, nervous that my beautiful crust would be ruined.</p>


	<p>Despite looking a bit disorganized, this tart was delicious. I didn&#8217;t have red onions, so I used yellow, and I didn&#8217;t have gruy√®re, so I used a sharp English cheddar. I also added a bit of diced pancetta to the onions just for fun. None of these variations seemed to hurt the preparation, and I&#8217;ll definitely make this again. Wouldn&#8217;t it be cute to make a few small ones for dinner guests?</p>


	<p>I was glad to have such comforting food in my belly an hour later, when I was almost run down in a crosswalk by an old bully wearing a fur coat. If you know me, it won&#8217;t surprise you to know that I gave his car a tap with my foot as it zoomed past, prompting him to pull over, and that the situation escalated into a screaming argument on 7th Avenue. The crazy coot even gave me the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6278419.stm">Isaiah Washington treatment</a>! Perhaps I&#8217;m guilty of <a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2007/01/26/pedestrian-interference/">pedestrian interference</a>, but I will still warn our New York readers to beware of a Mr. Silverstein who claims to live on 15th Street and has the license tag <span class="caps">HNY 660</span> on his blue Audi.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3323"><p>Yipes. I actually <I>did</i> get clipped by a passing car &#8212; within my first of living in <span class="caps">NYC</span>, no less. It was like getting hazed by the city itself.</p>
<p>And I reacted the way I hoped a real New Yorker would: by picking my (pregnant!) self up off the ground and unleashing a torrent of obscenities at this poor driver who was even more freaked out than I was.</p>
<p>All that aside, that onion tart has convinced me I definitely need a real, bigger food processor, because I could eat like, eight of those right now. (And no, I am not still pregnant.)</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3324"><p>Even here in Pittsburgh: I was nearly hit by a turning car, as I crossed Grant<br />
Street on a &#8220;walk&#8221; light, heading for my bus stop. In addition to screeching to a halt inches from my petrified self, he leaned on his horn and yelled at me.<br />
Something took me over, and I ran around the front of his car to the driver&#8217;s side and gave him an uncensored piece of my mind, complete with unrepeatable descriptions of his,uh, person. I will say, he looked startled.<br />
When I arrived at my bus stop, a woman who often waits there with me was smiling. She told me she had enjoyed my performance, but that I might want to think about not provoking people who were already acting crazy. She pointed out that some of them carry weapons. I think that was actually some pretty good advice, which I intend to follow in the future, assuming I can muster sufficient control.</p></div>
