		<div><p>Okay, call me obsessed, but I was back at <a href="http://www.costco.com/">Costco</a> again today, for the second time in less than a week. And no, I&#8217;m sure I wasn&#8217;t paying any less than I would have been paying in our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_District">Strip District</a> for similar products, and yes, I made some impulse buys, like a pair of Gloria Vanderbilt black jeans that fortunately are returnable. (Why does Gloria Vanderbilt make jeans, anyway, and who is she fitting them for?)</p>


	<p>They had a gal giving out samples of some of the cheeses I was rhapsodizing about last week, although I do think when folks hand out samples they should know a little something about the products. The answer she gave to any of my questions was, &#8220;These cheeses are French!&#8221; and she personally hadn&#8217;t tasted any of them. The three she was distributing were all semi-soft, with edible rinds, like Brie or goat cheese, but all made of cow&#8217;s milk. I bought the one that has a green leaf embossed on the top and tastes a bit like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limberger_cheese">Limburger</a> ; my parents are visiting soon and my father likes strong cheeses.</p>


	<p>I felt sorry for the fellow manning the seafood station because he was being completely ignored so I bought a 5-pound bag of mussels for our supper, at $1.99/pound. This may be hard to believe, but except for when I worked in catering, I have never cooked mussels and have never bought them for myself. I don&#8217;t even know if this is a good price.</p>


	<p>I found a recipe in my big yellow <em>Gourmet</em> cookbook, that also happens to be on the <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/">Epicurious</a> website for Spicy Thai Steamed Mussels. Although I know one wouldn&#8217;t normally serve bread with Thai food, one simply must have something to sop up the delicious juices in the bottom of the bowl so we had a baguette, too. I guess I can pretend I cooked one of those French/Vietnamese/Thai fusion meals, since we also had a spinach salad with vinaigrette dressing.</p>


	<p><strong>Spicy Thai Steamed Mussels</strong></p>


	<p><em>Serves 6 as a first course, 4 as a main course</em></p>


	<p style="float:right"><img src="../../../../files/thaimus.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<ul>
	<li>5 pounds mussels (preferably cultivated)</li>
		<li>1/3 cup lime juice</li>
		<li>1 (14-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk</li>
		<li>1/3 cup dry white wine</li>
		<li>1 1/2 tablespoons Thai red curry paste, or more, depending on spiciness of brand and personal taste</li>
		<li>1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
		<li>2 cups fresh cilantro sprigs &#8211; see <strong>note</strong></li>
	</ul>


	<p>Accompaniment: lime wedges</p>


	<p>Scrub mussels well and remove beards.  In an 8-quart wide pot combine lime juice, coconut milk, wine, curry paste, garlic, fish sauce, and sugar over high heat, stirring, 2 minutes. Add mussels, tossing to combine. Cook mussels, covered, stirring occasionally, until opened, about 5 to 8 minutes. (Discard any unopened mussels.) Chop cilantro and toss with mussels.</p>


	<p>Serve mussels with lime wedges.</p>


	<p><strong>Note</strong> &#8211; Maybe everyone already knows this but I didn&#8217;t until I read it on the <a href="http://dirtysugarcookies.blogspot.com/">Dirty Sugar Cookies</a> website; the stems of fresh cilantro are just as flavorful as the leaves so don&#8217;t discard them. All this time I had been picking the leaves off and throwing the stems away, like I do with fresh basil and parsley, but now I chop them up along with the leaves and use it all.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3572"><p>Hi, ladies! Thanks for all the comments; one thing I forgot to talk about in my original post, though, was, delicious as this recipe was, and much as I love mussels, it was extremely <strong>tedious</strong> to sort through and scrub them, one by one. Mussels are relatively small, and I had a five-pound bag of them. I don&#8217;t know of any quick way to clean them other than going through them and discarding the ones that are open and scrubbing and de-bearding the others. I wouldn&#8217;t want to prepare mussels for a crowd!</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3573"><p>Sometimes I&#8217;m careless and hasty when I clean mussels, and nothing bad happens.  But it doesn&#8217;t save that much time to be careless and hasty, either; it&#8217;s still a process.</p>
<p>And sometimes when I make Thai curries I cut the coconut milk with soy milk, to make myself feel virtuous and healthful . . .</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3574"><p>Hi, Abby; I used &#8220;light&#8221; coconut milk, although I didn&#8217;t read the ingredients on the can so I&#8217;m not sure what makes it light. I know &#8220;light&#8221; and nonfat half&amp;half have corn syrup and other disgusting junk in them and I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re much worse for you than plain cream.</p>
<p>As far as cleaning the mussels goes, I would just about be willing to do it again for our small family, but that&#8217;s about as many as I would want to sort and scrub, unless I had some help, or at least some company!</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3575"><p>I rinse mussels and give them a quick scrub. I don&#8217;t bother hunting for barnacles or hidden dirt, and I&#8217;ve never had a grit problem.</p>
<p>I think light coconut milk is just regular coconut milk thinned with water. You&#8217;re probably better off buying the regular kind and thinning it yourself.</p></div>
