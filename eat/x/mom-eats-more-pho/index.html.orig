		<div><p>Due to the <a href="http://technically.us/eat/articles/2006/07/22/first-kitchen-update">kitchen reconstruction</a> and all the eating out we have been doing this summer, we have somehow found ourselves on a quest to find the perfect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pho">pho</a>, especially as the season has wound down and the days have gotten cooler. As I mentioned in an earlier <a href="http://technically.us/eat/articles/2006/08/15/mom-eats-pho">post</a>, <em>Tram&#8217;s Kitchen</em> has always been a favorite, and their pho really cannot be improved upon. The broth is rich and flavorful, the beef is tender, and the basil and beansprouts are fresh and crunchy. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever ordered anything at Tram&#8217;s <strong>but</strong> pho, so can&#8217;t comment on their other dishes. A June, 2006 <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06166/698203-242.stm">review</a> in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette does mention a few of them, though, and favorably.</p>


	<p style="float:right"><img src="/eat/files/phominh.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Then there is <em>Pho Minh</em>, where we have gotten into the habit of eating lunch on Saturday with a few friends. The pho there reminds me of the <a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/835.html">poem</a> by Longfellow about the little girl who had the curl &#8220;right in the middle of her forehead&#8221; &#8211; when it is good it is very good indeed, and when it is bad it is horrid. That is, sometimes the broth is just right, and sometimes I think they must get a run on it Friday night so they throw a few gallons of water into it, it is so weak and flavorless when we order it. I really like their noodle bowls, though.</p>


	<p>Both the <a href="http://technically.us/eat/articles/2006/05/21/mom-goes-to-the-noodle-hut">Noodle Hut</a> in Regent Square, and the <a href="http://technically.us/eat/articles/2006/07/22/mom-eats-at-rose-tea-cafe">Rose Tea Cafe</a> have pho-like dishes, that is, bowls of broth with beef and noodles in them, but they&#8217;re not exactly like pho with the basil and the bean sprouts and lime, and that ineffable pho flavor, so I don&#8217;t think they qualify.</p>


	<p style="float:left"><img src="/eat/files/melyng.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Which brings me to <em>Me Lyng</em>, where we ate last night, because my <a href="http://www.billyprice.com">husband</a> got a bee in his bonnet after reading a post by someone named Rick on a website called <a href="http://www.chowhound.com/topics/show/316898">Chowhound</a> claiming that they had much better pho than Tram&#8217;s. It&#8217;s located in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead,_Pennsylvania">Homestead</a> , which isn&#8217;t easy to get to these days because of all the road construction, but we took a circuitous route and avoided most of the traffic. A bad sign was that even at the height of dinner hour there were only three tables occupied. We tried both the spring and summer rolls before ordering our pho; our son got a spicy vermicelli dish. The pho was truly horrible; the broth was simultaneously bland, salty, and greasy, with big slices of raw onion floating around in it &#8211; something I&#8217;ve never seen in pho. They didn&#8217;t serve any fresh basil or lime on the side, either, and eventually we doused our bowls with chili sauce to give it some flavor. And the beef was funky &#8211; gray, tough, overcooked, and gristly. Just thinking about the whole thing gives me a squeamish little shudder! I had heard a big sneeze from the direction of the kitchen but tried to ignore it, because at that point I still had an open mind, but now all I can think is that I hope I don&#8217;t come down with a cold in the next few days, and I really hope my husband doesn&#8217;t, since his singing helps pay our bills! <em>Tram&#8217;s</em> is still the king of pho in Pittsburgh as far as we are concerned, Rick notwithstanding.</p>


	<p>Addendum: I forgot to comment on the spring and summer rolls at Me Lyng; both terrible! The spring rolls were like hot pockets from the grocery store, not served with any dipping sauce at all, and the summer rolls, billed as &#8220;an appetizer like none you have ever tried&#8221; were simply rice paper rolled around iceberg lettuce and some chopped chicken and shrimp with no cilantro or seasoning of any kind, and served with a bowl of thick hoisin sauce to dip them in, which I thought was disgusting and bizarre. For the best summer rolls in town, go to the <em>Noodle Hut</em>.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-2670"><p>Tram&#8217;s is so fine. In addition to the pho, I can recommend the lemongrass fried fish, and the giant bowl of &#8220;wonton&#8221; soup, unlike any wonton soup of prior experience.  It has great little dumpling packets, and is all lemongrassy and peppery.</p>
<p>In addition to being delicious, it is the best &#8220;chicken soup for a cold&#8221; of my experience. It&#8217;ll put a dent in a respiratory flu like you wouldn&#8217;t believe. And the people are nice. Oh yes, the spring rolls &#8211; with peanut dipping sauce&#8230;</p></div>

<p>Next time you go, you should really try a noodle bowl, if you can pull yourself away from the Pho. I go for the pork and onions, Colin goes for the shredded pork and coconut milk. Both are amazing.</p></div>

I feel like I might be getting a cold, and I&#8217;m going to be sitting out in possibly inclement weather at the <a href="http://www.jaha.org/FolkFest/performers.html">Johnstown Folk Fesival</a> tomorrow night listening to <a href="http://www.billyprice.com">Billy</a> perform (all of you should come, too!) so maybe I&#8217;ll go with the soup on <a href="http://www.lindystoast.com/">Lindy&#8217;s</a> recommendation that it will cure what ails you.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-2676"><p>No luck on getting folks to switch the Saturday tradition! So I tried a different dish today, the spicy stir-fried beef with hot peppers and lemon grass. It was good, but had a pasty consistency that was little troubling. I still want that won-ton soup at Tram&#8217;s.</p></div>
