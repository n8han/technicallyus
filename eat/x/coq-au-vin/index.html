		<div><p>I signed up to be a recipe tester for Cook&#8217;s Illustrated, and my first recipe was for coq au vin. I had never made this dish before, although I&#8217;ve enjoyed it numerous times in restaurants. A thick, meaty red wine sauce is always a good idea.</p>


	<p>This is not a recipe I would have made normally, since I have such an <a href="../../articles/2006/03/15/bones.html">aversion</a> to boneless skinless chicken. In my evaluation, I told them it was a silly move. (<strong>January 2007 update: they took the breasts out of the recipe.</strong>) It doubles the cost of the ingredients, and it halves the flavor of the finished dish. Are people so afraid to eat around bones? It&#8217;s French country cooking! But I have already <a href="../../articles/2006/02/01/quick-cooking-from-cooks-illustrated.html">lamented</a> the fact that this magazine is now pandering to lazy cooks who can&#8217;t devote more than 15 minutes to preparing dinner.</p>


	<p style="float:center"><img src="../../../pictures/coqauvin.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Otherwise, it&#8217;s a good recipe. It took an hour and a half total. It strikes me that people who are willing to spend more than an hour cooking are not interested in sissy meat, such as this recipe calls for. I wish they had asked me to cut up a whole chicken, but I can do that on my own next time. The flavor and texture of the sauce were very appealing, and we continued to spoon it over our plates as we ate.</p>


	<p>It may be some kind of violation to provide the public with this test recipe, but I didn&#8217;t sign any confidentiality agreements, and anyone can sign up to test, so whatever. I&#8217;d recommend using bone-in chicken, and I&#8217;d also recommend cutting the bacon into small lardons in order to have a bit of smokiness in every bite.</p>


	<p><strong>Coq au vin</strong></p>


	<p>Be sure to discard the wine-brine rather than adding it to the stew along with the chicken breast to prevent the sauce from becoming too salty. Serve the stew with egg noodles or mashed potatoes.</p>


	<p><em>Serves 4 to 6</em></p>


	<p>1 bottle medium-bodied red wine <br> Salt <br> 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast halves, cut crosswise into even quarters <br> 10 sprigs fresh parsley plus 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves <br> 2 sprigs fresh thyme <br> 1 bay leaf <br> 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth <br> 6 ounces bacon, preferably thick-cut, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch pieces <br> 1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat <br> Ground black pepper <br> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter <br> 24 frozen pearl onions (evenly sized), thawed, drained, and patted dry (about 1 cup, or 5 ounces) <br> 8 ounces white button mushrooms, wiped clean, trimmed, halved if small and quartered if large <br> 2 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons) <br> 1 tablespoon tomato paste <br> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Stir 1/4 cup wine and 1 teaspoon salt in small bowl until salt is dissolved. Place chicken breast pieces in large zipper-lock bag; pour in wine mixture, seal bag, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes or up to 45 minutes.</li>
		<li>In large saucepan, simmer remaining wine, 10 sprigs parsley, thyme, bay, and broth medium-high heat until reduced to 3 cups, about 25 minutes. Remove and discard herbs.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, cook bacon in large Dutch oven over medium heat until fat has rendered and bacon is golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Remove bacon with slotted spoon to paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside. Discard all but 1 tablespoon fat.</li>
		<li>Season chicken thighs liberally with salt and pepper and fold in half. Heat remaining tablespoon bacon fat in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Brown thighs in single layer (thighs should remain folded in half to prevent overcooking) until just golden, 2 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to large plate.</li>
		<li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in now-empty Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When foaming subsides, add pearl onions and mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomato paste and cook 1 minute, stirring frequently. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter. When butter is melted, stir in flour and cook, stirring constantly, about 1 minute.</li>
		<li>Add chicken thighs, reserved cooked bacon, reduced wine/broth mixture, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; scrape bottom of pot with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits. Bring to boil over medium-high heat, reduce heat to medium-low, cover pot, and simmer 15 minutes; stir. Remove breast pieces from marinade and add to stew (discard marinade). Cover pot and simmer 10 minutes longer, until breast pieces are cooked through.</li>
		<li>Using slotted spoon, transfer chicken to large serving bowl; cover with foil to keep warm. Increase heat to medium-high and simmer sauce until it is thick, glossy, and measures 3 1/4 cups, about 5 minutes. Pour sauce over chicken and sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons parsley. Serve immediately.</li>

  			<div id="item-2133"><p>I know that the Best Recipe has a lengthy recipe for coq au vin that uses bone-in chicken. I plan to make it someday but the moment has never been right. It definitely looks like something I&#8217;ll end up spending several hours on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m one of those people who look for quick and easy recipes, although I want something that still tastes great even though it&#8217;s quick and easy. I certainly don&#8217;t shy away from long and complicated but it&#8217;s not practical every time I cook.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also like to note that one of life&#8217;s great disappointments is spending hours and hours on a recipe only to find out that it&#8217;s &#8230; ok. Not bad. Not terrible.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s <i>really</i> disheartening.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-6264"><p>Boneless chicken breasts are <span class="caps">MUCH</span>, <span class="caps">MUCH</span> healthier than random chicken bits stewed around for hours. Much lower in fat, much lower in cholesterol, much higher in protein. Using boneless breasts in this type of recipe is a no-brainer if you want to strike a balance between comfort/indulgence and nutritional value.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-6265"><p>I agree with you Leland, boneless breasts are a terrible idea for coq au vin. Personally, in my cooking I&#8217;m not interested in striking a balance between good flavor and nutritional value; I want it to taste good. I think that&#8217;s a no-brainer if you take the trouble to cook.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-6266"><p>Boneless chicken breasts are hardly worth feeding to a dog. They&#8217;re for people who want to pretend they&#8217;re not eating meat. And I would not call the other parts of the bird &#8220;random chicken bits.&#8221; Chickens actually have legs, thighs, and wings, all delicious.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-6611"><p>Health nut&#8217;s comment makes no sense at all.  The alternative to breasts are thighs and legs; the alternative to boneless is a whole chicken still having its bones.  Nut seems to have confused Leland with someone promoting chicken mcnuggets.  Also, Nut doesn&#8217;t know much about health, alas.  The whole bird is good!</p></div>
