		<div><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Price">Poppy</a> and I were returning from a weekend road trip to Virginia (less than successful due to the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15200095/">weather</a> down there!) via Route 522, which winds through apple country. Of course we&#8217;ve got lots of apples here in Pennsylvania, but Bill was excited about going to a big roadside market he&#8217;d made a habit of stopping at in the past. When we got there, though, the place was packed with tourists and travelers, and I could tell by the prices that they were merely brokers for lots of local orchards, so naturally I was too snooty to buy anything. If they&#8217;d had Honeycrisp or Northern Spy I might have changed my mind, but they were just selling standard varieties so we got back in the car.</p>


	<p>A few miles down the road we saw a hand-lettered sign directing us to an orchard a few miles off the highway, however, so we turned in, and found what I was looking for. A farmer (do you call orchard men farmers?) and his parents had a garage full of several types of apples, including some he called &#8220;banana&#8221;, which were a greeny-gold, small, crisp, and tart. We bought a big brown grocery bag of mixed banana, golden delicious (I like those mixed in my applesauce for their sweetness) and his Yorks, which were big, meaty, crisp, and tart.</p>


	<p style="float:left"><img src="/eat/files/crpie.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Today I made a batch of applesauce out of a mix of the three, and a pie from this <a href="http://www.elise.com/recipes/archives/002710sour_cream_apple_pie_with_streusel_topping.php">recipe</a> from the <a href="http://www.elise.com/recipes/">Simply Recipes</a> website. The pie is unusual in that the crust had to chill in the freezer for an hour before filling and baking. I was a little nervous that my spatterware pie plate might crack, not being sure if it was freezer-to-oven proof, but all was well. However, the applesauce was cooking while I was putting the pie together, and after I got the pie in the oven I began to notice something unusual about the apples in the pot. Two varieties had completely disintegrated while one of them was still as hard as a rock. &#8220;Oh no!&#8221;, I thought, &#8220;Is that the York, the one I just made the pie with?!&#8221; And sure enough, it was.</p>


	<p>As of now, 4 hours after I started it, the pot of applesauce is <strong>still</strong> cooking and those darn Yorks still haven&#8217;t broken down! I wound up baking the pie at least twice as long as the recipe called for, lowering the heat a bit so the crust wouldn&#8217;t blacken, but I can tell from sticking a sharp knife into it that the apples are still too hard. I finally took it out after about 90 minutes, because I was afraid of incinerating the crust and crumb topping. I just know my dinner guests are going to try to reassure me and tell me it&#8217;s not that bad, while I am gritting my teeth and crunching through those tough apples!</p>


	<p>Lesson learned the hard way (heh-heh, at least I can still make foodie puns); do <strong>not</strong> use York apples to cook with! I did this so you, dear readers, don&#8217;t have to! They are an eating apple, not a cooking apple.</p>


	<p><strong>Addendum to apple pie with crumb topping</strong> &#8211; Even though, as I feared, the apples were a bit underdone, this is a wonderful recipe. The flavors are divine, and I will definitely try it again, with appropriate cooking apples.</p></div>

<p>Route 522 goes all the way to Virginia? I had no idea.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-2895"><p>I&#8217;ve learned so much from this post. Honeycrisp and Northern Spy are good apples to buy from roadside farmers, and no Yorks in pies. Oh-and try Elise&#8217;s pie recipe.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very snooty about my peaches. I won&#8217;t buy any after August 15. It&#8217;s a Georgia thing.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-2896"><p>I had my first Northern Spy last weekend, from Locust Grove farms at the greenmarket in New York. So delicious! I had no idea! I&#8217;ve been on a bit of an apple kick myself&#8212;I&#8217;ll be sure to stay away from Yorks, though, except for snacking.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-2897"><p>Julie, after I read your comment I doubted myself since geography isn&#8217;t my strong suit (in fact it&#8217;s always the category my opponents pick to stump me in Trivial Pursuit); I began to think we had actually been in West Virginia when we bought the apples, and we were in West Virginia for part of the trip, so I checked the map and found that 522 does bisect the top corner of Virginia. We took it between 70 and 66.</p>
<p>Yes, Anne, those late-season peaches can be very hit-or-miss and apt to be mealy (gag!).</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen the Northern Spy yet, Barletta, but according to Lindy on <a href="http://www.lindystoast.com">Toast</a> they are the best apples for pie.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-2898"><p>The pie looks fantastic!!!!  I wish I had read this column before my stop at a fantastic roadside stand on Rte 30 in the Laurel Highlands (PA) this afternoon.  They had a huge variety of apples (as well as a 761 pound pumpkin) where for $2 or $4 you could fill a small or large bucket with any apples you wanted. I didn&#8217;t have time to dawdle, so just threw in six different varieties of eating apples, but have no idea which is which.  It was refreshing to not see the &#8220;same old same old&#8221;. The apples also had blemishes and no wax coating &#8211; another welcome change from the supermarket!</p></div>
