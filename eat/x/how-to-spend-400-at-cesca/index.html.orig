		<div><p>We got ourselves into a crazy situation last night, where we were forced to eat at <a href="http://www.cescanyc.com/"></a> and to spend $400 on our meal. I won a contest on this <a href="http://thedish.amexnetwork.com/NYC">random American Express website</a> by writing two sentences about why I wanted to eat at </p>
<p>I spent the week looking over the menu and wine list, trying to crunch the numbers and make it to $400. </p>
<p>Anyway, back to our money problems. I announced to the server right away what our situation was, and she said she already knew about the gift certificate (since Amex made the reservation for us, I guess, and scored us a sweet corner booth). She suggested a strategy of several courses and nice bottle of wine, and so we ate like a couple of starving tramps. With our glasses of sparking Italian castaldi ($15 each), we enjoyed a duck salad ($15), delicious parmesan-pancetta fritters ($9), and the burratina special ($14). After taking a short break, we moved onto the special farrotto of the day, with lamb ragù, goat cheese, brussels sprouts, and mint ($28). It was my favorite dish of the night, deeply lamby and intense. We also had the disappointing scallops and cauliflower, served under a bland sauce of capers, raisins, and pancetta ($30). The scallops were fine but I&#8217;ve had better versions of this dish. If your sauce of capers and raisins ends up bland, you have done something terribly wrong.</p>
<p>At this point we were quite full, but we trudged through two desserts ($10 each): a warm chocolate cake with gelato and coffee soil, and an Italian cheesecake. The chocolate cake&#8217;s flavor was intense and good, but its chilly interior revealed its careless execution. The cheesecake was too salty to be called a dessert, and I&#8217;m someone who doesn&#8217;t mind plenty of salt in his sweets.</p>
<p>After all of this eating and drinking, we had only spent $271. I confessed to the server that we were full, and told her she would have to keep the remaining money as her tip. &#8220;Sorry, the gift certificate is for product only,&#8221; she replied. <em>What?</em> Not to sound ungrateful, but this was a real buzzkill. Why wouldn&#8217;t they tell us that on the gift certificate, or when we were discussing how to reach the magic number? Had I known, I would have ordered a much more expensive bottle of wine. The only way to get the bill high enough was to have her cork another bottle of $100 wine, pour us tiny glasses of it, and then bag it (you can take wine to go in New York, but only if it&#8217;s been opened and started).</p>
<p>The wine made a sweet parting gift, but I felt a little disappointed having to leave an $80 tip when I had an outrageous gift certificate to use. It didn&#8217;t leave me feeling very pampered, to say the least, although of course it was all worth it. I just wish I had known about it from the beginning, and I sent a message to American Express telling them as much.</p></div>
