	<p>I am <em>done</em> with Richard Olney, for the moment anyway. I&#8217;ve had one of those weekends that Orangette <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.com/2007/04/safe-bet.html">described</a> recently, where everything you try to do in the kitchen seems cursed. It wasn&#8217;t even the entire weekend, but really just Saturday. I had been looking forward to making Olney&#8217;s zucchini pie for weeks, and Saturday was my big day. I was feeling pretty confident after so many Olney successes; could this elaborate preparation be out of my reach?</p>


	<p>First there was the dough to make, a Provençal olive oil dough, which sounds easy. How hard could an oily dough be to keep together? Hard as hell, it seems. This dough was crumbleville, even with the full 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup water in it, and I&#8217;m not experienced enough to know what to do when it simply won&#8217;t hold together no matter how much I work it. The dough ended up in the trash, which didn&#8217;t seem too tragic since I had a large disk of Pierre Hermé&#8217;s buttery <a href="http://technically.us/eat/articles/2007/04/22/how-can-you-mend-a-broken-tart">dough</a> in the freezer, but it&#8217;s never fun losing two cups of Sir Galahad.</p>


	<p>Anyway, the dough was just one part of the ridiculous puzzle. There were the 10 ounces of zucchini, which had to be diced, salted, and left to disgorge for <em>two hours</em>. So I got that going, and then I started roasting the garlic that was to be mixed with the zucchini, and stewing the onion that was going in there as well. Once I had the my parmesan grated and everything else for the filling mixed together, I rolled out my pastry, which just wouldn&#8217;t thaw enough, so it kept splitting. But I finally got it in there, poked a couple of holes in it, brushed it with oil, and got it in the oven after about three hours of preparation.</p>


	<p>In the meantime, I cut up a raw chicken and cooked the legs and breasts. I couldn&#8217;t even get that right. The pan wasn&#8217;t hot enough, the skin wasn&#8217;t brown enough, and the meat just wouldn&#8217;t cook. I finally threw it under the broiler, and even then I had a pink center on the legs. I had cooked them for an hour! So we ate the breasts, saved the legs after cooking them a bit more, and made stock of the carcass.</p>


	<p>The zucchini pie, which I took out of the oven once it seemed like it was going to catch on fire, was good, for its crust and filling. No surprise there. But what a waste of time and ingredients. I must have done something wrong, or missed some step. It didn&#8217;t sound as hard it was. (Neither did Olney&#8217;s coffee custard, which I made before anything else and which never set, even after 24 hours in the refrigerator. Grrr!)</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3698"><p>Among other things I cooked on Sunday, I threw together a loaf of bread, just so we&#8217;d have sandwiches this week. Then, Sunday night while we were out it suddenly occurred to me that I forgot to put salt in the bread. Not a disaster, but annoying. As I have said before, this kind of thing is more likely to happen with stuff I make all the time; I&#8217;m not paying as much attention.</p></div>
