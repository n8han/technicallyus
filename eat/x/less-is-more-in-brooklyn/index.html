<p>It&#8217;s been just over a week now since I left my <a href="../moving-up-in-the-world/index.html">vast Harlem kitchen</a> for the comforts of Brooklyn. The allure of private outdoor space was irresistible, but fleeting. With a thousand mosquitoes constantly lying in wait at the backdoor for their meal, I found that I didn&#8217;t take advantage of the garden as I might have under other circumstances. That combined with the utter dearth of anything to do or anywhere to shop near where we lived was enough to send us packing after a depressingly short nine-month stint in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>But the irritation of moving twice in one year is overshadowed by the sense of peace and freedom that Nathan and I are finding in Brooklyn Heights. We&#8217;re not on the most beautiful or most historic <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=schermerhorn+street+and+boerum+place,+brooklyn&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=48.374125,64.863281&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16">stretch</a>, but we are in a modern apartment in a grand old co-op building. It&#8217;s near the subway, Smith Street, and <a href="../sahadis.1.html">Sahadi&#8217;s</a>, and we&#8217;ll be staying put for at least five years.</p>
<p class="out"><img src="../../../resources/com.typeturner.Typeturner/image%3Fname=kitchen2" class="out" alt="" /></p>
<p>The big change for me is the size of the kitchen. It&#8217;s much smaller than the ridiculous space I had in Harlem, although I am in no way complaining. This is an excellent kitchen for New York, and the apartment is small in general. It will just take a bit of time to get used to having one drawer instead of twelve.</p>
<p>The problem really is that that the Harlem apartment&#8217;s kitchen was much too big. No rental apartment needs a dozen big drawers and even more cabinets. I had drawers in there with practically nothing in them. I ended up collecting a lot of junk that I had to get rid of upon moving. And then that ridiculous island, which had enough room for eight people to work. It made me disorganized. I found myself using up the entire surface when making a grilled cheese sandwich. There is such a thing as having too much space!</p>
<p class="out"><img src="../../../resources/com.typeturner.Typeturner/image%3Fname=kitchen3" class="out" alt="" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve cooked several times in my little Brooklyn kitchen, and I genuinely enjoy the challenge. Having a bit less room to work forces me to organize myself and be tidy. My whole operation is cleaner and more streamlined. Having a dishwasher helps, and the Viking range makes the whole experience more enjoyable. (The Harlem place was fabulous except for the dinky, generic, piece of junk range that I fought with daily.)</p>
<p>The open storage is surprisingly handy. I&#8217;m keeping everything I use all the time there and tucking other items away in the few little cabinets I have. The lowboy fridge and freezer haven&#8217;t bothered me yet, although I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;d rather have more fridge and less freezer. An ice maker wouldn&#8217;t be amiss, either.</p>
<p>Overall, this little kitchen is going to whip me into shape. No more collecting useless cooking utensils. No more hoarding pre-ground spices from the early 2000s. No more letting week-old leftovers use up precious fridge real estate. I intend to exit this apartment a more organized man than I was when I entered it.</p></div>

<p>Lindy: yes, I did have drawers that were mostly empty, horrifying though that may sound? Or I&#8217;d have a whole drawer with something like a placemat and a knife box in it. It was embarassing, and I could never find anything. No danger of that happening here.</p></div>

<p>We, too, are leaving our Union Square neighborhood for Brooklyn. Our move has more to do with our baby and needing a 2-bedroom, which is impossibly unaffordable where we live now.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be in Prospect Heights, right across from the B&#8217;lyn Farmers Market. Yay, Brooklyn!</p>
