		<div><p>How many of you have folders full of recipes clipped from newspapers and magazines sitting around in your house somewhere? How many of those recipes have you actually tried? For years I clipped recipes and stuffed them in my acrylic cookbook stand, a kitchen accessory which has served as an informal standing file, holding appliance instruction booklets and warranty cards (often for appliances I no longer even own); newspaper food sections waiting to be harvested for clipping; current issues of cooking magazines, labels from cans, bottles, and packages printed with recipes that I like or want to try; recipes printed from the internet; and scads of clipped recipes waiting to be filed, some going back years, if not decades. The last time I went through everything in there I even found the rules that came with the <a href="http://www.llbean.com/">L. L. Bean</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croquet">croquet</a> set.</p>
<p>When we moved in 1999 I weeded out over half of the clipped recipes and taped most of the rest onto index cards so I could actually file them in my recipe box. This was the first time I had thrown any recipes away since my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szHsaOjGvfk">husband</a> and I had combined our kitchens 21 years ago, and I decided it was safe to get rid of the instructions for making such things as <em>Coquilles St. Jacques</em>, one he brought to the marriage. If he hasn&#8217;t made it by now I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to happen. My only rule was not to throw any recipes away that were hand-written by beloved dead people, which meant that I kept all my grandmother&#8217;s recipe cards, even the ones that call for cake mixes or crushed corn chips.</p>
<p>Last week I was flipping through the recipe box and found a clipping from the <a href="http://www.pittsburghpostgazette.com/">Post-Gazette</a> for <strong>Chinese Roast Chicken</strong>. I can&#8217;t remember what year this was printed, but I know we were still in the old house when I used to make it a lot, so it was at least eight years ago. Somehow I forgot all about it and how good it is. See what you think.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese Roast Chicken</strong> from <em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em> long time ago</p>
<p><em>serves 4</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>1 whole broiler-fryer chicken</li>
	<li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
	<li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger (or minced fresh ginger)</li>
	<li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix all ingredients except chicken to make marinade. In medium bowl or ziplock bag, place chicken and pour marinade over it. Cover, put in refrigerator and marinate at least 1 hour (may be left in overnight). Place chicken, breast down, on rack in roasting pan; baste with marinade. Put in 350ยบ oven and, basting every 15 minutes, roast until chicken is dark brown and fork can be inserted with ease, about 1-1/2 hours. You may turn chicken over for the last 15 minutes to brown breast side. Make sure you check for doneness with a meat thermometer; it should read 165-175ยบ in the thickest part of the thigh.</p>

<p>To serve, garnish with finely sliced scallions. You may boil remaining marinade and use it as a sauce for the chicken and some rice.</p></div>

<p>I have a growing file of recipes printed from the internet and copied from cookbooks. I know I&#8217;ll never make most of them, but I look at them and think, &#8220;This looks great!&#8221;, and back into the file they go.</p></div>

<p>p.s Aren&#8217;t you going to Paris any day??</p></div>

printouts and label recipes.  I have a vinyl note<br />
book filled with clear page protectors and I just<br />
slide whatever in there.  If you are really organized<br />
you can have a book for various kinds of recipes.</p></div>

<p>Hi, izzy&#8217;s mama &#8211; yes, we&#8217;re leaving for Paris on November 4th! The summer went by quick, didn&#8217;t it?! It looks like the clubs are kind of spread out, though, so we may be doing a lot of driving and not spending much time in the city.</p>
<p>I have seen those books, Friend of Ted, and they do look like a great solution to the problem of odd-sized print-outs and clippings. Maybe I can hire someone to come in and do the organizing for me&#8230;</p></div>

  			<div id="item-5474"><p>I have made the Chinese roasted chicken twice in the last two months. I always turn it over during the last 15 minutes for the breast to brown. It is so moist and juicy. However; I add about a 1/2 cup of water to the bottom of the pan to keep the drippings from burning. And I do the basting every 15 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe!</p></div>
