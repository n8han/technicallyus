		<div><p>About six months ago, Nathan and I accepted a delivery from FreshDirect that contained, in addition to our normal groceries, four boxes of Aunt Jemima frozen waffle products. At first I thought the two of us needed to have a talk, because I know Nathan has a secret craving for sweet breakfast treats. Maybe he was tired of my salty bagels. Then I realized it was a packing error, and we hadn&#8217;t been charged for it.</p>


	<p>As FreshDirect has gotten more popular around the city, and as competition has increased from places like Whole Foods and <a href="../../articles/2006/03/07/trader-joes-a-rant.html">Trader Joe&#8217;s</a>, they&#8217;ve starting sending the most bizarre things our way. Sometimes it&#8217;s on purpose, sometimes not. Last week, we got a big box of tall kitchen bags (not on the packing slip). This morning, in addition a promotional packaged, prepared meal (you know how much I love those), we got a half gallon of 1% milk. This is especially weird because they did it on purpose—it&#8217;s listed as a &#8220;Free Sample&#8221; on the packing slip—and because we order whole milk almost every week. Lastly, and this is sort of annoying because my freezer is full, we got a 25-ounce tub of frozen cookie dough:</p>


	<p style="float:center"><img src="../../../pictures/cookiedough.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>I&#8217;m starting a category here of the weird free stuff we get from FD. I&#8217;m not complaining;  I love freebies. But how did they decide to give us milk? Maybe they have a big bin of surplus products, and if you&#8217;re a regular customer they just starting throwing extra stuff in your boxes. I say keep it coming.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-1752"><p>I&#8217;ve received 25 pounds of meat free although under different circumstances.  Bought one of their bulk meat deals, they forgot to deliver that box, I called up, they confirmed with driver it was missing, rescheduled a delivery for 2 days later.  1 hour later the driver comes back with the original beef order, doesn&#8217;t ask for a signature.  2 days later I have 50 lbs of meat in my apt.</p>
<p>Usually FD forgets things in my order- maybe 1/3 orders is missing an item and of course it&#8217;s always the key piece to that evening&#8217;s meal.  Never got any real freebies though.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-1754"><p>Well you can sort of see on the label that it has approximately 9894872 different ingredients in it. I&#8217;ll just hang onto them and pop them in the oven when we have company or something.</p>
<p>JMoney: I can&#8217;t believe you ordered 25 pounds of meat and ended up with 50! Did you <em>ever</em> finish it? They finally stopped forgetting things in my order; maybe they were tired of my constant complaining.</p></div>

It&#8217;s lasted an insanely long time.  Every now and again I&#8217;ll move something around in the freezer and find some contorted frozen steak hidden in there.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-1763"><p>Hey there!<br />
So I was told about getting $50 for new customers but like Robyn NO <span class="caps">ONE</span> is giving me that code.  Then a chef friend gave me a a coupon code for $75 that she got for new customers with corporate orders, she&#8217;s already an existing customer which is why she gave it to me.  long story short they dont deliver to my area &amp; when I offered to pick it up at there <span class="caps">LIC</span> facility they said NO!! Not with the discount.  So at this point its just personal. I&#8217;m feeling like david v.goliath!! Can anyone help??</p>
<p>thanks!</p></div>
