		<div><p>I&#8217;d eventually lilke to have an ice cream maker, but I&#8217;m waiting until I get a stand mixer so that I can just get the attachment, instead of getting two separate appliances. I love the idea of making my own ice creams and sorbets, and I was thrilled to find a recipe for sorbet that didn&#8217;t need an ice cream maker at all. Paul Bertolli&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609608932/eat0e-20"><em>Cooking by Hand</em></a> is full of recipes that you can do mostly without special appliances. This is great for people with small kitchens (and no good for people who aren&#8217;t willing to spend a lot of time to make something that could easily be bought).</p>


	<p>You do need a food processor for this sorbet, although a blender might work too. And you need a quart of the most fragrant and delicious strawberries you can find.</p>


	<p><img src="/pictures/sorbet.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>The recipe is barely a recipe. Stem the strawberries, spread them on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and freeze them solid (about two hours). Put the berries in a food processor with 5 tablespoons of sugar, and pulse them until the fruit breaks up. Add 1/4 cup of water and pur√©e the mixture. Pour it into a container, and freeze for about two more hours, until you can scoop it. I stirred it periodically as it was freezing, but this is not in the directions.</p>


	<p>Bertolli writes that the intensity of this sorbet &#8220;is due to the low cutting action of the processor blades.&#8221; And it does taste and smell intensely of strawberries. If you start this recipe about two hours before a summer dinner party, you can shock your guests at the end of the meal by pulling out a quart of beautiful homemade sorbet, which they&#8217;ll smell before they can see.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3901"><p>Yum, yum, yum. I&#8217;m with Jeannie, sorbet is better than ice cream. You can also add rum, triple sec and some lime juice and call this a daiquiri, that&#8217;s what I did with about half the strawberries I picked last year. You really should get yourself a stand mixer. I&#8217;m really, really sorry I don&#8217;t live closer to you, I have a source for getting them at cost.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3903"><p>Jeannie&#8217;s right, now I know what to do with those strawberries in my fridge. Thanks! And yes, sorbet&#8217;s better than ice cream, although my husband, Rob, would definitely disagree. Now, I think that mixing that with other berries would be killer too.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3905"><p>Good luck, Jeannie! Let me know how it turns out.</p>
<p>Mary: get back here with your source! Just kidding&#8212;I&#8217;m going to ask for one for Christmas this year.</p>
<p>Aunt Sue: I wondered that too. It sounds like Friend of Ted, below, did it with cherries and had success. It&#8217;s definitely worth trying! I would probably want to pass it through the food mill, though, to get rid of those pesky seeds.</p>
<p>Christine, and everyone else: as much as I enjoy sorbet, I am an ice cream boy at heart. My first boyfriend was always shocked at how much ice cream we ate in our house. He used to say, &#8220;Yinz go through ice cream like water!&#8221; I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve ever bought sorbet.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3908"><p>We used to make this in the summer here, down South, with Scuppernong grapes.  Really delicious. They&#8217;re just as fragrant as the berries, but like cherries, you have to usually deal with the skin factor.   I did have an aunt who peeled her scuppernongs before turning them into preserves/jelly/sorbet, but she was a far more patient soul than myself. <br />
I&#8217;m so glad you posted a good recipe for it using the food processor!  I&#8217;m totally going to make some this weekend!</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3909"><p>Sorbet is really amazing stuff, especially in the summer.  Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have a food processor or a blender (though, at one point, I owned two of each), but I forwarded this along to a couple people who would probably enjoy making this.</p></div>

<p>Hi Susan. Mmm, I love the sound of Scuppernong grapes. What a great word, scuppernong.</p>
<p>Colin: I wonder if you could do it by hand, by chopping and stirring aggressively. Probably not worth it.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-6661"><p>I made sorbet this weekend.I used a 1/2 bag of frozen whole strawberries (or use as much as you like).,and three bananas ( frozen )added 1 tablespoon of smuckers all fruit strawberry jam. Put it all in the food processor and processed away. It is so good. I am going to experiment because I love sorbet since I can&#8217;t have ice cream anymore because of the fat content. By the way, does anyone have any sorbet recipes with lavender in it? I would love to have it.</p></div>
