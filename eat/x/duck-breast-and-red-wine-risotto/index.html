		<div><p>Last night I made a dinner full of interesting textures and flavors. I was originally just going to make duck, which I had been meaning and planning to do for, oh, about a year. Then I came across an Amanda Hesser <a href="http://wednesdaychef.typepad.com/the_wednesday_chef/2006/01/amanda_hessers_.html">recipe</a> for red wine risotto at wednesdaychef, and I thought that would be a good accompaniment. Turns out I was right:</p>


	<p style="float:center"><img src="../../../pictures/duck.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>I know that everything on the plate is purple. Actually it all looks brown in the photo. Monochromaticity aside, however, this plate was a hit. I didn&#8217;t know what I would make to go with the duck originally, and I love to come across a recipe for which I have all of the ingredients on hand. Of course I have red wine, arborio rice, and parmesan cheese, and it was a happy coincidence that I had a few cups of homemade chicken stock. Eating this risotto is like eating red wine. It makes your toes curl, and if you don&#8217;t like red wine, it will make you sick.</p>


	<p>The duck was good too, but have any of you made duck? It&#8217;s weird. Sometimes it feels like making chicken, because you&#8217;re thinking about how it&#8217;s a bird, but the recipe keeps telling you it should be rare, so then it&#8217;s like beef. And it has this centimeter-thick layer of fat on top of it that acts like bacon and makes an enormous amount of grease. Anyway, I got the recipe from this cute book at work called <a href="http://www.longitudebooks.com/find/p/7407/mcms.html">Pedaling through Burgundy</a>, part of a series written by Sarah Leah Chase, a woman who rode her bike around France and wrote some books about it. It involved roasting a duck breast for about 15 minutes in a 450Â°F oven with minced shallot, carrot, and rosemary, and then making a pan sauce with the drippings and beef stock. (I was told to &#8220;fan out&#8221; the slices of meat, but I don&#8217;t have the patience for that, especially without a good slicing knife.)</p>


	<p>So this duck was all fine and dandy, but am I supposed to eat all that fat on the plate? I like the taste of the rare duck, but I can&#8217;t abide all the blubber. If I don&#8217;t eat it, do I throw it away? Or do I melt it and then cook with it? Last question: all of these pan sauce recipes have me strain and discard the solids, in this case the shallot, carrot, and rosemary. Is there any reason I can&#8217;t disobey that directive? I think the oft-discarded solids are the tastiest part of the dish, and I gleefully sprinkled them all over my magret!</p></div>

<p><em>Slicing</em> knife. Psh. All in good time, my pretty, all in good time.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-1395"><p>What&#8217;s wrong with your new global knife? I&#8217;m sure that would have sliced the hell out of that duck!! Personally I am not fond of rare duck, trendiness be damned. And I agree that the bits in the pan can be very tasty and I am also loath to discard them, tending to scarf them down in the kitchen when no one else is looking. I&#8217;m not big on straining sauces, kind of liking the look and texture of bits in my sauces. More rustic. I&#8217;m sure peasants and country cooks in Europe aren&#8217;t in their kitchens with strainers and never have been! Wasteful, if nothing else.</p>

  			<div id="item-1396"><p>You are right: the risotto is just like eating red wine. Well said.</p>
<p>As for duck fat, if you&#8217;ve never had oven-roasted potatoes in duck fat you&#8217;re in for a treat. Try to find duck recipes in which you roast or fry out a lot of the fat into a pan. Pour that liquid gold into a container and it will solidify. Use this whenever you make roasted potatoes. It&#8217;s out of this world (and incidentally, duck fat is very expensive when buying it from a store, so &#8220;making&#8221; your own is economical as well as delicious).</p></div>
