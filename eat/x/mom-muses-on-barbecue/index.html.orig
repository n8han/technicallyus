		<div><p>Those of you who subscribe to the comments feed on this blog must be aware of the recent controversy regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbecue">barbecue</a> . To me what&#8217;s so strange about it is that the original post had nothing to do with barbecue at all; it was about a road trip that involved a stop at <a href="http://www.tamarackwv.com/">Tamarack</a> in West Virginia. Then one reader happened to mention that she would be going to State College the following week and a second reader suggested that she stop at <a href="http://www.roadfood.com/Reviews/Photo.aspx?RefID=3722&amp;PhotoID=7624">Clem&#8217;s Barbecue</a> while there. Incidentally, second reader must not follow the links in our blog, because first reader was Lindy of <a href="http://www.lindystoast.com/">Toast</a> who wrote a whole <a href="http://www.lindystoast.com/2005/07/nittany_picking.html">post</a> about Clem&#8217;s at least a year before.<br />
<img src="http://technically.us/resources/com.typeturner.Typeturner/image?name=PeaceBBQ" title="PeaceBBQ" alt="PeaceBBQ" /></p>
<p>Anyway, that was about it until last month, when HungryfordecentBBQ must have eaten at Clem&#8217;s and obviously had an unhappy experience. I guess he or she then googled Clem&#8217;s and hit on my post, after which the fur started flying. It&#8217;s funny that I assumed that Hungry was a woman and my husband automatically thought he/she was a man. My assumption was based on my thinking that only a woman would be so particular about her food and then take the time to follow up like that, and he assumes that barbecue is a man&#8217;s specialty. I can&#8217;t understand why Hungry didn&#8217;t comment on Lindy&#8217;s blog, since she has actual posts devoted to Clem&#8217;s, how much she likes it and the flavor of their sauce. I was also quite excited to read comments from Clem&#8217;s themselves, since it&#8217;s the first time someone from a restaurant has written on the blog, outside of that violent busboy from <a href="http://technically.us/eat/x/problems-at-il-pizzaiolo/">Il Pizzaiolo</a> who thought a reader should be punched in the face.</p>
<p>I think my favorite part of the flame war was when Hungry said that she would feed the whole mess to her dogs but she happens to like her dogs. Clem&#8217;s countered soon after that with the assertion that they sell over 15,000 pounds of meat a week and asks Hungry how many pounds a week she sells. My husband said that &#8220;Hungry wants to stop the inevitable evolution of the English language. You can&#8217;t stop it. All arguments of the form [x should not be called y because y means&#8230;.] are a waste of energy.&#8221; That&#8217;s the argument he gives me when I rail against people who insist on saying &#8220;ciabatta <span class="caps">BREAD</span>&#8221; (ciabatta IS bread!) or mispronouncing &#8220;bruschetta&#8221; (the &#8220;ch&#8221; should sound like &#8220;k&#8221;). In Pittsburgh we have a lot of waitresses who snap their gum while asking &#8220;Do yunz want aw juice with that?&#8221; Um, &#8220;aw&#8221; or &#8220;au&#8221; <span class="caps">MEANS</span> &#8220;with&#8221;! Maybe my husband is right about the inevitability of foreign words becoming degraded in our country, but I don&#8217;t think you can use that argument with barbecue. It&#8217;s just too important.</p>
<p>On another subject entirely, and not even food-related, I was ignored this week by the sons of a girlfriend to whom I had placed friend requests on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/index.php?lh=dca7b12a0cce3f5322a660e79b070682">Facebook</a>&amp; and thinking about that led me to come of with a list of Top Ten indicators that you just may be too old to have a Facebook account, which I offer for your amusement. I may post these on my Facebook wall, so if you look at that you can stop reading now.</p>
<ul>
	<li>1. You have fewer than 50/25/10 friends</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>2. Of your &#8220;friends&#8221;, you are related to many/most of them</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>3. Any of your male friends are bald</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>4. When searching for your peers on Facebook you keep finding their offspring instead</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>5. You don&#8217;t know how/don&#8217;t bother downloading your photo on your profile page</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>6. You don&#8217;t know how any of the applications work</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>7. You write on your own wall (and if you didn&#8217;t you wouldn&#8217;t have anything on there at all)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>8. You tag yourself in photos</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>9. You fill out the information blanks in your profile page completely seriously</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>10. The penultimate digit of your high school or college graduation year is not a zero</li>
</ul></div>
