		<div><p>I had guests for dinner tonight and served them a terribly disappointing meal; the spareribs were tough, the sweet potatoes were underdone and had to be finished off in the microwave, and I even overcooked the green beans a little bit. In fact, I&#8217;m beginning to wonder about my new oven, because those ribs and potatoes really should have been tender in the amount of time they spent baking. I need to get an oven thermometer and check the temperature for accuracy.</p>

	<p>Fortunately I was able to redeem myself with a luscious apple pie, the first one of fall. I was a little worried that the apples might not be cooked enough after eating the rest of the dinner, especially because it was such a big pie, but I used Macintosh apples and they get soft more readily than other varieties. Some people like the apples in their pie to keep their shape and even stay a little crunchy but I am not one of them. I like them to become meltingly tender and almost turn into applesauce. I really hate biting into a slice of pie and having the apples offer resistance to my teeth. I bought the apples at <a href="http://www.mcginnis-sisters.com/">McGinnis Sisters</a> yesterday; they were from a local orchard and had a divine flavor, winey and tart.</p></div>

<p>When I cook disappointing meals my boyfriend insists they&#8217;re fine and earts heartily, but I get so annoyed at myself that I lose my appetite.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-2820"><p>Very funny, zp, and you&#8217;re right, I was harder on the guests than I was on myself because I didn&#8217;t even eat the ribs but being good guests the way they were they gnawed their way through them. I simply deemed them inedible and left them on my plate, but I would never do that in someone else&#8217;s house! And I&#8217;m not even referring to your execrable play on words&#8230; :)</p></div>

  			<div id="item-2822"><p>I feel an apple pie coming on. Yours looks wonderful. My favorite pie apple is the Northern Spy-but they have an even shorter season than the Honeycrisps. they are quite a late apple, and not ready yet in PA.</p>
<p>I know I&#8217;m supposed to apologize and explain as much as I do, but I think in the case of food gone very wrong, and guests, it&#8217;s only fair to say so..it gives them permission to leave it on the plate.</p>
<p>Or maybe not&#8230;I&#8217;d probably still try to eat it at someone else&#8217;s house.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-2823"><p>Unfortunately, Julie, Calvin beat me to the last slice but it&#8217;s just as well because after the outragous way I behaved with those ginger cookies I really didn&#8217;t need to eat apple pie for breakfast, although I agree with you, it makes a fine breakfast; my mother used to put pie in a cereal bowl and pour milk over it. I have been known to heat a slice and pour heavy cream over it but that really is gilding the lily and makes a pretty rich morning meal.</p>
<p>Lindy, I think you mean you know you&#8217;re <strong>not</strong> supposed to apologize and explain, and I know what you mean, guests, unless they&#8217;re real cooks, don&#8217;t understand that they&#8217;re not expected to reassure you and try to make you feel better, that you&#8217;re actually just objectively critiquing your own meal and maybe trying to figure out what went wrong. Now in the case of these ribs I wouldn&#8217;t have minded someone saying something like &#8220;You must be disappointed after what you spent on the meat.&#8221; because I did get good meat from McGinnis Sisters, but when they started saying, &#8220;No, it&#8217;s delicious!&#8221; I just realized it was time to shut up.</p></div>
