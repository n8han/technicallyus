	<p>From Poppy:</p>


	<p>So, we are at the <a href="http://www.paradores-spain.com/spain/pcardona.html">Parador de Cardona</a>, a huge 9th-century castle on
the top of a mountain overlooking the small town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardona">Cardona</a>. The
Spanish government funds the paradors as a way of promoting tourism
in Spain in areas that normally don&#8217;t attract tourists such as, well,
Cardona. They get lots and lots of tourists going to Madrid,
Barcelona, and the coastal towns, but not so many to other places.
One consequence of this is that the towns around many of the paradors
are not used to tourists, and very few people speak English. So we
are having a difficult time understanding people and making ourselves
understood.</p>


	<p>The restaurants at the paradors serve beautifully presented
indigenous food that is a little weird and not all that satisfying,
at least not to me. So tonight, we wanted to go into Cardona to eat
instead of eating in the parador. We got a girl at the desk to
recommend a couple of bar-restaurants to us in Cardona, although she
was reluctant to do so because, of course, they want everyone to stay
put and eat in the restaurant here on the grounds. So we ventured
forth and wound up in a clean, well-lighted little place where we had
had coffee the day before&#8212;we didn&#8217;t recognize the name when the girl
recommended it to us.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s a little place run by a guy and his wife, and as we walked in,
there were three girls eating pizza and a guy next to us eating pizza
and a salad. Mom got excited to see the salad because they are kind
of rare around here, and the pizza was a welcome sight to me because
of its relative familiarity. I dined last night on some rather funky
grilled lamb loin chops, and Mom had some fish loin (that&#8217;s what the
menu said, but I&#8217;m still wondering how a fish could have loins) with
lots of bones in it. So, the guy who owns the place walks over and
hands us menus in English, which was another welcome sight. However,
the English translator did not fully succeed in rendering the menu
choices into vernacular that was recognizable by two Pittsburgh-based
Americans. There was a regular menu and a pizza menu, and the pizza
menu was divided into a &#8220;Pizza&#8221; page and a &#8220;Slice&#8221; page. Mom pointed
to the salad that the guy next to us was eating and attempted to
indicate that that was what she wanted. A salad sounded great to me
too, so I indicated that I wanted one too. The guy pointed to one of
the items under the &#8220;Slice&#8221; menu, indicating what it was that the guy
next to us was eating, and we enthusiastically nodded our heads.</p>


	<p>Now things get interesting. I then pointed to the Pizza page and
attempted to order a pizza margarita with ham for me and a plain
pizza margarita for Mom. The guy seemed a little incredulous, and we
all attempted to make ourselves understood to one another. He
summarized what it was that he thought we were ordering, which we
assumed to be two salads and two pizzas&#8212;the salads, we figured, were
listed on the page with the &#8220;Slice&#8221; heading. So we nod in
affirmation, and he goes away. Mom is hoping to get her salad soon,
but after a bit of a long wait, he walks over with two identical
things that look like pizzas, but the &#8220;dough&#8221; that they are on is
more like large pieces of bread. And the fact that they are identical
is a bit puzzling, since we thought we ordered two different kinds of
pizza. He then looks at me and says, &#8220;pizza margarita ham,&#8221; or some
such thing, and I nod enthusiastically in affirmation. However, upon
further examination, we confirm that the two pizza things are
identical, and there is no ham in evidence on either. Meanwhile, Mom
waits for the delivery of the salad, which never happens.</p>


	<p>Midway through the pizzas, with my appetite rapidly becoming
satiated, I begin to be gripped by a certain fear. What if he thinks
we want two more pizzas? Could two more pizzas be coming our way?
Sure enough, he arrives shortly carrying a pizza margarita and a
pizza margarita that is loaded with small pieces of ham. And no
salad. Too late, we realized that the guy next to us was also eating
a pizza-like thing. So, we had ordered two of those, which we now
understood to be what the Spaniards mean by &#8220;Slice,&#8221; and two pizzas.
When we were pointing at what the guy next to us was eating, the
owner assumed we meant the Slice, not the salad. The salad, we later
learned, wasn&#8217;t even on the menu. We learned this because Mom,
wanting her salad, was not to be denied. She walked up to the counter
and ultimately was able to make the guy understand what she wanted,
which she soon got. I, however, now stuffed with pizza/Slice, was now
staring at two additional pizza margaritas on the table, which I
understood it to be my duty to eat. I finished most of the margarita
and two slices of the ham/margarita before surrendering. Fully an
hour later, I am still stuffed and may never need to eat again.</p></div>
