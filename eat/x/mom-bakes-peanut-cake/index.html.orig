		<div><p>Is there anyone who doesn&#8217;t like the combination of chocolate and peanut butter? I find it addictive, and my interest is always snagged by recipes containing both ingredients.</p>


	<p>Years ago, easily more than thirty, my mother gave my sister and me matching <a href="http://www.landolakes.com/">Land &#8216;o Lakes</a> recipe card file boxes when we left home. The boxes came with printed dividers and quite a few recipes already in them, mostly for baked goods containing Land &#8216;o Lakes butter, naturally, and <em>Smilin&#8217; Fresh Eggs</em>, which I guess were a brand of eggs being marketed by the company at the time. Most of the recipes were useless to me but my sister alerted me to one for a cake that she and I still make today, <strong>Peanut Butter Cake Squares</strong>. I have blown many a diet by baking this cake and then not being able to resist eating it, but this time I was taking it to a Memorial Day picnic so I knew I wouldn&#8217;t be bringing any home and I didn&#8217;t. Every speck got eaten (although I did have a piece myself but that&#8217;s because there wasn&#8217;t anything else at the picnic worth eating!)</p>


	<p>This is my fall-back cake when I need to make something in a hurry; I almost always have the ingredients on hand and everyone loves it. It doesn&#8217;t need to be frosted because the topping is baked right on, and it is served from the baking pan so it&#8217;s easy to carry. The recipe calls for buttermilk but regular milk can easily be soured by replacing 1 tablespoon of the milk with 1 tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice and letting it sit for a few minutes, or do what I did the other day &#8211; thin out a small container of plain yogurt with a little milk to make 1 cup. And don&#8217;t forget that buttermilk actually keeps much longer than the freshness date on the carton indicates &#8211; it&#8217;s kind of like eggs that way. I think my sister occasionally mixes a banana into the cake batter; I don&#8217;t know why she would want to mess with perfection but if you love bananas you may want to try it.</p>


	<p>I feel so sorry for people with peanut allergies, don&#8217;t you?</p>


	<p><strong>Peanut Butter Cake Squares</strong> from Land &#8216;o Lakes recipe box long time ago</p>

  			<div id="item-3835"><p>Wow. I&#8217;ve got to try this one. I&#8217;m a sucker for the pb and chocolate combo, too. Plus, I find I have a growing interest in finding &#8220;back of the box&#8221; and other &#8220;corporate&#8221; recipes that turn out to be long-lasting gems. Jeffrey Steingarten wrote a fun article on the topic, titled &#8220;Back of the Box&#8221; in February 1992 in (I think) <i>Vogue</i> magazine. I found it in his first book of collected essays, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iyUxAAAACAAJ"><i>The Man Who Ate Everything</i></a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I haven&#8217;t baked in a long time and was looking for an excuse to do it again. Now I have it. Thanks!</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3836"><p>Hi, Mac! I like back of the box recipes, too &#8211; I think they tend to be pretty good, probably because, unlike a lot of cookbook recipes these days, they have been tested and re-tested. One of my favorite cookie recipes is off the back of a <a href="http://www.bgfoods.com/brand_brerrabbit.asp">Brer Rabbit</a> molasses bottle from the late 60s.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3837"><p>This looks so good, and I know my husband will just love it &#8212; his favorite candy is a reece&#8217;s peanut butter cup (me, too, when I&#8217;m not watching my waistline)&#8230;  I&#8217;m just afraid to make it because I know that I will eat it all!!</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3838"><p>I sure was drooling because I love this cake so much and now that I&#8217;m not eating sweets anymore&#8230;well you get the picture.  Actually I double the amount of peanut butter in the cake because it makes it more moist.  Maybe we can make this at the lake this summer!</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3839"><p>Sue and Susan &#8211; You&#8217;ll just have to do what I did and only make this cake when you know a crowd will be there to eat it (allow yourself a tiny slice!)</p>
<p>And Sue, I&#8217;ll try putting extra peanut butter in the batter next time, although I think it&#8217;s already pretty moist with the buttermilk as long as you&#8217;re careful not to overbake it. Maybe we can make it for the party up at the lake.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3840"><p>This cake looks fantastic.</p>
<p>When I eat peanut butter, which is a rare occasion, I really enjoy the freshly made stuff that&#8217;s a bit gooey and still has chunks of peanut in it &mdash; the real deal, if you will.  And, it looks pretty gross when it&#8217;s been sitting around for a bit and has had the chance to separate.</p>
<p>Would you suggest using that sort of peanut butter or the mass-produced kind that never separates?</p>
<p>Oh, and another question.  In the photo, there are bits of the topping that look somewhat like Rice Krispies.  Are those just pieces of peanut?</p></div>

  			<div id="item-3841"><p>Hi, Colin &#8211; We eat a lot of natural peanut butter here, my husband likes it for breakfast with banana, so we always have both kinds on hand since Calvin will only eat Jif. I generally use the Jif for this cake since I don&#8217;t want to be bothered with the stirring, etc. when I&#8217;m baking, or using the more expensive ingredients when I don&#8217;t think you can tell the difference. And I think it might be hard to mix up the topping with the natural separating all over the place. And speaking of the topping, I can see what you mean in the photo but those aren&#8217;t Rice Krispies, they&#8217;re just the streusel-like crumbs of the topping!</p></div>
