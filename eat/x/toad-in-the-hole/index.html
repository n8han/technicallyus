		<div><p>While my fellow food bloggers are busy celebrating spring by preparing <a href="http://kitchenography.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/04/asparagus_mimos.html">asparagus</a>, lovely <a href="http://www.lindystoast.com/2006/05/pasta_salad_com.html">springtime pasta salads</a>, and other spring <a href="http://wednesdaychef.typepad.com/the_wednesday_chef/2006/05/russ_parsons_br.html">greens</a>, I am marching to the beat of a different drummer by thinking about English nursery food.</p>


	<p>We still have a nip in the air here in Pittsburgh, our farmer&#8217;s markets aren&#8217;t open yet, and I had a package of plump, pork country sausages made by the butcher shop of my favorite <a href="http://www.mcginnis-sisters.com/">food purveyor</a> sitting in the freezer that I wanted to use before summer begins. When Leland cooked his <a href="../../articles/2006/05/06/jacques-pépins-scallop-soufflé.html">scallop soufflé</a> last week I found myself fixating on toad in the hole, and thinking how much it has in common with what Leland made&#8212;an eggy batter mixed with protein and baked in the oven until it puffs up.</p>


	<p>I am a long-time reader of English literature, and have always been attracted to descriptions of certain of their foods, particularly what you might call nursery food&#8212;shortbread, biscuits, bread and butter or toast cut into &#8220;soldiers&#8221;, puddings of all kinds, pies with custard (why don&#8217;t we serve it like that in this country?). I also like the idea of the full English breakfast with fried bread and grilled tomatoes and mushrooms. On the other hand, they can keep their suet and their Marmite.</p>


	<p>The first time I read <em>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,</em> by C.S. Lewis was as an adult, out loud, to Leland and his brother Jon, in the car on a trip to the Adirondacks. I will never forget the passage where the Pevensie children are welcomed by Mr. and Mrs. Beaver and given a meal in their home and the vivid description of all the food they ate for tea. I remember my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Price">husband</a> and I looking at each other and salivating, and I can just imagine the impact the book had on a generation of war and ration book-deprived London children. Later on in the book Edmond is seduced by the White Witch when she offers him sweets which he can&#8217;t resist, a plot development which must have made complete sense to kids who hadn&#8217;t had sugar for as long as they could remember.</p>


	<p>A series of adult books I&#8217;ve read recently begins with one called <em>Not All Tarts Are Apple</em>, by Pip Granger. The first two are told from the point of view of a plucky 7-year old in post-war London who has been adopted by a couple who run a cafe. She is obsessed with food as most children in those days must have been and there are lots of great food scenes in the books. They&#8217;re funny, too.</p>


	<p>Anyway, back to the toad in the hole. I got the <a href="http://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/toad-in-the-hole-with-roasted-onion-gravy,1030,RC.html">recipe</a> from <a href="http://www.deliaonline.com/">Delia online</a>, which is written by a well-known British cook named Delia Smith. She&#8217;s got a no-nonsense, brusque way about her, in the manner of Margaret Thatcher. The Brits seem to respond to this type of treatment, and all I can say about that is that it&#8217;s good Hitler wasn&#8217;t a woman wearing a nanny uniform or the English probably wouldn&#8217;t have had the will to resist and we might all be marching in goose-step formation today.</p>


	<p style="float:left"><img src="../../../pictures/toad.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>This being written by an Englishwoman and all, there were a few puzzling moments for me, like when she asked me to cook one thing on a baking tray and another thing on a baking tin. Then there was the &#8220;dessertspoonful&#8221; measurement that threw me; I had to call an English friend to ask what that meant. I&#8217;m glad I did, because I thought it must mean something small, like a demitasse spoon, when in fact it&#8217;s quite big, about two tablespoons.</p>


	<p>I increased the proportions of the batter a bit, since I was serving 3 of us as a main course. The onion gravy I made with half vegetable stock and half chicken stock, and half the Worchestershire sauce the recipe called for. I put the finished dish on the table with a bit of trepidation; after all, my husband is Jewish and my son is a teenager. I was a little afraid of getting the reaction from my husband that my mother got when she served him scrapple for the first time (prompting his rewriting the old Christmas carol to &#8220;Walking in a Presbyterian Wonderland&#8221;).</p>


	<p style="float:right"><img src="../../files/tdgrvy.JPG" alt="" /></p>


	<p>But I needn&#8217;t have worried; they both loved it! In fact I barely got to eat any myself and the platter was licked clean. My hat&#8217;s off to Miss Smith with the gravy as well, and she&#8217;s right, it would be terrific with mashed potatoes should you ever find yourself with any and no sauce for them.</p></div>

loved it. I know my husband would.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the British-ness of the recipe, especially the instruction to bake until the &#8220;centre&#8221; was no longer &#8220;squidgy.&#8221;</p></div>

  			<div id="item-2033"><p>Caroline&#8212;While I don&#8217;t think Toad in the Hole would be much good without the toad, Delia Smith had a nice collection of vegetarian <a href="http://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/selections/vegetarian-main-courses-who-needs-meat,178,RS.html">recipes</a> on her website you might want to check out. A lot of you Brits seem to be vegetarians, so I guess she caters to that.</p>
<p>The one negative about her website is that she&#8217;s trying to sell her recipe collections, but she makes a selection available for free, I guess to whet our appetites.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-2035"><p>What a great post, Lindy, and your toad looks beautiful! I&#8217;m thinking a &#8220;nob&#8221; may correspond to a &#8220;dessertspoonful&#8221;, what do you think?</p>
<p>The only thing I question in Jamie Oliver&#8217;s recipe is the balsamic vinegar in the onion gravy; it may be delicious but it seems too trendy in such an old-fashioned dish. I think Delia Smith&#8217;s mustard powder and Worchestershire sauce is probably much more authentic. You know, when she said this gravy was good with mashed potato, it didn&#8217;t even occur to me that she may have meant along with the toad, but maybe she did, reading Jamie Oliver&#8217;s recommendations!</p></div>

  			<div id="item-2036"><p>You&#8217;re right about the gravy, I think. his toad was a bit avant-garde too, so I ditched the recommended rosemary. Somethings gussy up better than others.<br />
Anythow, I love mustard and Worcestershire sauce.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-5251"><p>Yes Delia&#8217;s recipes are pretty good but please could you give up on the British generalisations??? Far from falling in line with Delia&#8217;s brusque manner, most of the country found her so annoying that her TV series came to a quick halt.</p></div>

  			<div id="item-6563"><p>Sorry but &#8216;a brit&#8217; is completely wrong. Delia is a national institution in England, she has been around since the late sixties/early seventies and had many series and books. Her most recent show was aired here in December 09 and she has another series in the pipeline.<br />
She is a tried and trusted cook and not a Trendy Wendy &#8216;chef&#8217;.<br />
Her books would be found in most British homes, keep your shouty, swearing &#8216;chefs&#8217; and give me Delia anytime. A true English lady and fabulous cook.</p></div>

I&#8217;ll let you into a secret&#8230;.a lot of the generalisations are true and we love them and are proud of them. The only thing I would say is that &#8216;British&#8217; is not the same as English, Scottish, Irish or Welsh.
