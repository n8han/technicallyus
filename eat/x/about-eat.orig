<h3>Mom</h3>
<p class="out"><img src="/pictures/mom.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I learned a lot about cooking from my mother, a great cook in her own right. I further honed my skills by spending a couple of years in an apprentice program in which I went to school and at the same time worked at the <a href="http://www.watergatehotel.com/">Watergate Hotel</a> in Washington, D.C. This was back in the early 70s and was one of the first programs to train young Americans in the culinary arts; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s still in existence. My budding career was cut short when I became pregnant with Leland&#8217;s older brother&#8212;standing on your feet for ten hours in a restaurant kitchen and lifting 50-pound stockpots do not mix with pregnancy.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s how I wound up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, where Jon and Leland were born, and the home town of their father. Since then I have had a diverse professional life, including working for many years in the field of mental health and chemical dependency treatment. I never lost my love of cooking, though, and I always cooked for friends and family.</p>
<p>When I &#8216;retired&#8217; from the mental health field I got back into cooking a little bit by working in a small kitchenware store, catering off and on, teaching a few cooking classes, taking some classes myself, and continuing to cook for fun.</p>
<p>I am remarried to Pittsburgh singer/songwriter <a href="http://www.billyprice.com">Billy Price</a>. We have four great kids&#8212;Jon, Leland, Valerie, and Calvin. Bill and I volunteer for an organization called <a href="http:www.helpourmarriage.com">Retrouvaille</a> and I&#8217;m proud of our efforts on the behalf of the hurting couples who get help from us. For fun I am an avid reader with eclectic tastes. I love to shop, especially bargain-hunting, and travel. We just returned from our 20-year anniversary trip to Spain in November where we had a great time, mostly eating and touring various markets; in two weeks I think we went to one museum! The highlight of 2006, aside from the trip, was our holiday open house. We entertained over 120 people, and Leland and I did all the cooking ourselves! The whole family pulled together to make the party a success, moving furniture, decorating, greeting the guests, hanging up coats, and just making sure everything went as smoothly as possible when there&#8217;s that kind of crush in the house. It was a lot of fun.</p>
<h3>Leland</h3>
<p class="out"><img src="/pictures/leland1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I started Eat in October 2005, shortly after <a href="http://technically.us/n8">Nathan</a> began running a server out of our tiny New York apartment. I had been on blogger, but I was tired of having such little control and being subject to blogger&#8217;s technical problems. I like to have my tech support under the same roof. Mom started posting at the end of February 2006, and it&#8217;s been a fun way for us to do something together even though we live far apart.</p>
<p>As a child and teenager, I was a typical momma&#8217;s boy, spending as much time in the kitchen with her as she would allow me to. I learned a lot just by watching her, and sometimes she&#8217;d let me help with a dinner party. Of course now that I&#8217;m grown up, I regret not learning more. This blog is a way to rectify that situation.</p>
<p>When I was in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenley_High_School">high school</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_mellon">college</a>, I worked in a number of restaurants. I even did a stint making crêpes at Crêpes Parisiennes in Shadyside. But I never harbored any dreams of cooking professionally, and I still don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I have lived with <a href="http://technically.us/doc">Nathan</a> in the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=east+11th+street+and+university+place+10003&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=17&amp;ll=40.7333,-73.993317&amp;spn=0.006106,0.011523&amp;om=1">Central</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village">Village</a> since the summer of 2004.</p></div>

<p>I am Jiayun, a final year student at the London College of Communication.  For one of my final year projects I am working on an editorial compilation of soups from all around the world to represent all the different cultures and people&#8217;s tastes.</p>
<p>I chanced upon your blog and thought it would be great if you could spare some time to send me photos of soup and if I publish yours in my book, your name will be in it too! :)</p>
<p>It could be any kind of soup, even soup your friend is having, a stranger&#8217;s soup, soups could be savoury, sweet, thick, watery, hot, cold, instant, anything really, as long as it&#8217;s <span class="caps">SOUP</span>!</p>
<p>send the photos along with information like:<br />
name of soup<br />
source (name of restaurant/made by XX/came from a can)<br />
rough ingredients<br />
any interesting facts/quotes (eg.&#8220;mum&#8217;s specialty!&#8221;)</p>
<p>feel free to send in more than one entry by mid-February 2007 and I look forward to your reply! :)</p></div>
