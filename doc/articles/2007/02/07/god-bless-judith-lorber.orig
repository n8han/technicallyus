	<p class="break">(I have no idea if that is true.) You know how you&#8217;re supposed to go to college and get your head filled up with a bunch of loopy Marxist ideas that evaporate before your twenty-fifth birthday? That didn&#8217;t happen to me. Never even got through the <em>Manifesto</em>. But then computer science is in the School of Arts in name only.</p>


	<p>None of my <em>core</em> classes were very communist either. First semester freshman year I endured a dreadfully arrogant honors seminar that officially had no focus. Unofficially it was the director of the honor&#8217;s program&#8217;s house of torture for smart people who still somehow believed in God at age eighteen. We read (as much as you &#8220;read&#8221; in those classes) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/God-Biography-Jack-Miles/dp/0679743685">God: a Biography</a>, which analyzed the absurdity of the Bible with all the disinterest of an <acronym title="">OSHA</acronym> audit. As a foundation for civilization the Bible fell laughably short, which I had already suspected but finally knew.</p>


	<p>Mostly the core curriculum was a waste of time. Particularly the honors classes I chose that had anything to do with the then-fashionable &#8220;study&#8221; of globalization. The horror. What the hell were we supposed to be learning in a class about <em>that</em>? We thought some benevolent corporation would hire us after graduation and fly us around the world in order to speak foreign languages poorly and <em>recognize tropes</em> or something. We can be forgiven for such childish fantasies, but our teachers should be flailed for promoting them. The pinnacle of this idiocy for me was a course titled <em>World Political Economy</em> that I foolishly took my last semester of college. It was taught by a friendly-seeming old gent named <a href="http://www.ratevtteachers.com/detail.asp?id=2743">Edward Weisband</a>.</p>


	<p>Weisband was visibly invigorated by his made-up discipline, but not so much that he could be bothered to teach it more than one hour a week, prepare exams himself, grade anything, or resolve problems between his students and the legion of TAs he farmed them out to. Even his damn TAs thought <em>they</em> were the shit and made themselves as inaccessible as possible. These faults became apparent before the drop date, but you don&#8217;t drop a required course your last semester of college. The TAs bungled multiple exams in some shockingly bad ways, enough that I figured we would all get A&#8217;s just to keep us quiet. Nope. I made out with a C (my first and only), which required one Latin word to be struck from my diploma.</p>


	<p class="break">From this 2005 testimonial, it looks like not much has changed in Weisband land since my own detour there:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>I have now taken roughly 35 classes at VT, and this class comes in second in worst classes so far. This class should be atleast a 3000 level class and not a freshman level one&#8230; If you like learning new words, that really do not exist take this class&#8230; If you like paying out $70 to Weisband, since he writes the book, take this class. By the way, the bookstore doesn&#8217;t buy back the book either, so this old guy gets even richer each semester with a new edition. Also, the TA&#8217;s are a little weird too. Avoid this class if possible.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>I know that for some students this experience is typical, and to them I say, &#8220;Why would you pay for that?&#8221; For me, no other class was in the same ballpark of Marie-Antoinette-style aloof and destructive academic detachment as Weisband&#8217;s. He pretty much ruined my opinion of college education. Him and the non-stop money grubbing and growth mentality exhibited by the school&#8217;s administration. American universities must be the least efficient use of capital in the history of &#8220;world political&#8221; economy.</p>
