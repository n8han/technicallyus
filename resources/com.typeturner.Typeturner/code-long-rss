  &lt;p&gt;Conspicuously missing here is any mention of patent reform. Congress is currently working on a patent overhaul called the America Invents Act. Google is one of the world’s largest and most prominent victims of our innovation-taxing patent system, so lobbying for better patent laws seems like an obvious way to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;

elite media establishment would use when it tried to suss out the latest
“hacker” arrests? Wait no longer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/26/technology/for-suspected-hackers-a-sense-of-social-protest.html"&gt;For Suspected Hackers, a Sense of Social Protest (&lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The F.B.I.’s arrests of 14 people last week were the most ambitious crackdown yet on a loose-knit group of hackers called Anonymous…&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;But at least some of the suspects are not your typical
    hard-core hackers, judging from interviews with two of them and
    the online traces of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever they base their idea of typical hard-core hackers on (&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gWhG5RbW-28/Tfp6uQaSTkI/AAAAAAAAAm4/v5-6r80ilRc/s1600/Hackers22.jpg"&gt;Acid Burn&lt;/a&gt;?) we’ll never know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some did not bother to cover their digital tracks as they
    participated in what they saw as an online protest. And some
    say they were unaware that their feverish clicks on a home
    computer may have been against the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the author’s futile attempt to jazz up the story with
overwrought language, we see here that every statement is
cloaked in &lt;strong&gt;pedantically skeptical reportage&lt;/strong&gt; to the absurd point that
we’re unsure if someone was truly &lt;em&gt;unaware&lt;/em&gt; that something &lt;em&gt;may
have been&lt;/em&gt; against the law. What does that even mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While federal law enforcement officials are clearly keen to
    quash the notion that online attacks are a form of social
    protest…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this “notion” is an &lt;a href="http://pastebin.com/RA15ix7S"&gt;easily verifiable fact&lt;/a&gt;, it will be
difficult to quash. There are many forms of social protest,
even violent ones. Riots are illegal pretty much 
everywhere, but the fact that some of them are
protests is never in dispute. If someone says their disruptive
activity is a protest, it’s a protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Drew Phillips, a wry, serious 26-year-old programmer with a
    paunch that testifies to hours spent hunched over a computer…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years later, &lt;strong&gt;the word “hunch”&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;a href="http://technically.us/code/x/posturing-about-programming/"&gt;still required by the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;
style guide&lt;/a&gt; for stories about the people who make
everyone else’s computers workie. Yes, the computers
that almost everyone else is also sitting in front of all day long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe that is partly why &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/weightloss/2010-01-13-obesity-rates_N.htm"&gt;one third of Americans are
obese&lt;/a&gt;. That’s right, not just one third of 
programmer-Americans—but one third of regular &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; Americans. It
must be shocking to the newshounds at the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, whose
respectable friends stay slim on a diet of
Jamba Juice, pilates, and cocaine, but yes—outside their circles
having a small belly is a testament that you need another KFC Double Down,
not that you are an exotic “computer user”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;admits to joining one of those chat rooms when the attack was
    being discussed, and to tinkering with the program used in the
    attack. He said he could have obscured his Internet Protocol
    address, which can be used to identify a computer, had he
    thought that anyone was interested in what he was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So he &lt;em&gt;admits&lt;/em&gt; to joining a chat room!&lt;/strong&gt; What great times we live in guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mr. Phillips admits he was sympathetic to the strike against
    PayPal, but he maintains he did not actually participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughtcrime, check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Federal agents were interested in what he was doing with the
    Low Orbit Ion Cannon software. Mr. Phillips, who works for a
    solar energy company, said he used it to test the endurance of
    his employer’s computer systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He says all he did was &lt;strong&gt;write some code and talk about
it&lt;/strong&gt;.  That is, he didn’t participate in the DDOS attacks. If he
had, he would have taken the trouble to disguise his IP address,
because duh. If this is true (prediction: it is), then the
prosecutors have no evidence that he participated in the actual
attacks. Nevertheless…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They left with all his equipment: a server he had built
    himself, a desktop, two laptops and several flash
    drives. Federal agents returned last week to arrest him,
    charging him with causing damage to a protected computer and a
    related conspiracy charge. He says wryly that he suspects the
    government needed to make an example out of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How very wry! His arrest must be such a light topic, for this “wry,
serious” (?) programmer who was supposedly unaware that writing 
load testing software and talking about it is definitely maybe
against some law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A federal law enforcement official, who would not be named
    because he was not authorized to speak about an active case,
    argued that denial-of-service attacks like the one against
    PayPal were costly and illegal: “These things are costing
    companies millions of dollars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being costly is irrelevant. &lt;strong&gt;Boycotts are costly&lt;/strong&gt;, but are legal
and even praiseworthy. The legality of DOS is only relevant to
the extent that there is evidence this person carried out a DOS
attack. None has been presented. In other words, this useless 
anonymously sourced paragraph seems to have been dropped
into the story from a great height, with no connection to
anything that came before it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The official acknowledged that some of those arrested “used
    unsophisticated techniques.” But when asked if the authorities
    were overreacting, he said, “No, it’s never heavy-handed to
    address violations of law, particularly in this arena of
    cybersecurity, where the threat is so pervasive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they &lt;em&gt;admit&lt;/em&gt; to making an example of people! How wry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In Jacksonville, Fla., another self-taught programmer named
    Keith Downey was also angered last December by PayPal’s stance
    toward WikiLeaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teaching yourself programming—bypassing the institutions charged
with dispensing such education for merely $50,000 a year or
whatever—is very suspicious indeed. If people can teach
themselves the most useful knowledge in the modern world, who
will subsidize the education of hack reporters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And in general, he was dismayed at what he saw as increasing
    government control over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said, she said. Who can definitively state that &lt;strong&gt;government is
increasing its control of the internet&lt;/strong&gt; when it has started
&lt;a href="http://torrentfreak.com/u-s-government-shuts-down-84000-websites-by-mistake-110216/"&gt;seizing domain names&lt;/a&gt;, advising private companies &lt;a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2010/12/07/mastercard-shuts-donations-wikileaks-calling-site-illegal/"&gt;to cut
off certain accounts&lt;/a&gt; based on no law at all, and is
plotting to grant itself the power to &lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20029282-281.html"&gt;shutdown the
internet&lt;/a&gt; and/or create a &lt;a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/148377/congress_has_plans_for_an_internet_blacklist_in_the_works__lets_stop_this_now"&gt;blacklist&lt;/a&gt;?  Certainly
not the even-keeled &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;! They report a mishmash of
subjectively qualified facts wrapped in snide cliches, you decide
whether or not the guy with the paunch is a weirdo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He logged on from home, also without bothering to use tools
    that would help shield his identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then this dude actually did participate in the DOS, but he
thinks it should be legal or he thinks it should be a minor
offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He likened it to “the college sit-ins of the ’70s” and even to
    Gandhi’s civil disobedience movement against British rule. No
    one in the chat rooms apparently bothered to explain that
    Gandhi spent a lot of time in jail, as did antiwar protesters
    in the 1970s. Mr. Downing wasn’t prepared to be arrested last
    week. Nor is he financially prepared to travel across the
    country for his court appearance in San Jose, Calif., in
    September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no one has bothered to explain to the editors of this piece
that neither Gandhi nor those &lt;strong&gt;legendary boomer hippies&lt;/strong&gt; were
required to travel 2,700 miles at their own expense to stand
trial. That’s because it’s a new, &lt;em&gt;innovative&lt;/em&gt; way for government to undermine
the presumption of innocence, by making all sorts of loosely defined nonviolent acts
into federal offenses with big numbers attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And is anyone really “prepared” to go to jail, and happy about
it when interviewed? It’s unclear where the comparison with
protesters of yore is supposed to break down, according to this
stupidly aloof newspaper article. Is it that Gandhi didn’t
have a paunch?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mr. Downey, who had a small business installing and maintaining
  computer hardware for local music studios, lost his computer
  equipment during an F.B.I. raid in January. He lives with his
  widowed mother, who was laid off from her job earlier this
  year. Mr. Downey says he is patching together construction work
  to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah. Now it all makes sense. He had been using the equipment to
support himself and his recently laid off mother, one of our
country’s &lt;strong&gt;9% unemployed&lt;/strong&gt;. As he waits to stand trial, the
government has seized all the tools that he needs to
be productive in this economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s what we call… &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/winning-the-future/"&gt;WINNING THE FUTURE&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://code.technically.us/post/8108116332</link><guid>http://code.technically.us/post/8108116332</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2011 21:00:00 -0400</pubDate><category>NYT</category><category>Hacktivism</category><category>Hack Reporters</category><category>Anonymous</category></item><item><title>Community Management</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Were you annoyed because the &lt;a href="http://databinder.3617998.n2.nabble.com/"&gt;old&lt;/a&gt; Dispatch and Unfiltered forums did not have a Google+ notification bar at the top of every screen?&lt;/p&gt;

for being naughty with a computer. It’s almost as if governments
are having an existential crisis, now that most of our economic,
cultural, intellectual, and political activity occurs in the
electronic realm. They’re grumpy and confused, having failed so far
to establish their accustomed monopoly on violence here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington’s various kill switch and blacklist bills are an
attempt to do just that, but most people—to the dismay of
bought-off politicians and avid authoritarians—like the
internet pretty much as it is. It’s not that we don’t have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt;
problems with information security. It’s that the measures they
are desperate to enact do nothing for the problems we do have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is evidently too busy plotting various &lt;a href="http://freethoughtmanifesto.blogspot.com/2011/06/cyberwar-stuxnet-people-in-glass-houses.html"&gt;cyber and non-cyber wars&lt;/a&gt;;
it does have the time or interest to deal with the sloppy companies we entrust
with our personal data and actual money, who constantly violate that trust by &lt;strong&gt;failing
at basic security&lt;/strong&gt;. Most of our consumer transactions are
secured by nothing more than a fifteen digit number and a four digit date,
as they have been since the disco era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally! A few months ago some joker charged a cool five
grand to one of my credit cards, though the final cost to me
personally was just a few hours on the phone. During one of those
conversations I learned that someone had previously called and
changed my account’s email address, a classic social engineering
attack. Even after this revelation, which no one I spoke with
fully appreciated, they continued to refer to the incident as a
mere “disputed charge”. I am certain that no one will be held
accountable for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only Barack Obama could just &lt;strong&gt;shut off the internet&lt;/strong&gt; every
time a credit card is used fraudulently, that would solve the
problem, &lt;em&gt;riiiiight?&lt;/em&gt; Or put the credit card company’s site on a
blacklist. Those are such great, practical solutions to the
pervasive failures of our insecure financial systems. Ha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; help are permanent financial incentives for securing
those systems. We could easily create such
incentives by charging fines for allowing any exploit to occur. (If you want,
it could be revenue neutral, where the more secure companies would
get a payout of the fines collected.) So for example, there should be an
official web site to easily report your sloppy credit card company for giving up your
account. Imagine that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our government’s priorities are manifestly elsewhere. They
are with jailing open-access advocates like Aaron Swartz:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He faces up to 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines for
    charges related to wire fraud, computer fraud and unlawfully
    obtaining information from a protected computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a programmer, you have to wonder why crimes in your area of
expertise carry penalties that are at least &lt;strong&gt;an order of magnitude&lt;/strong&gt;
greater than old fashioned crimes. How many years do you go to
prison if you steal a book?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of “stealing”…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;United States attorney, Carmen M. Ortiz, said: “Stealing is
    stealing, whether you use a computer command or a crowbar, and
    whether you take documents, data or dollars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only that were at all true! If stealing were stealing, Ortiz
would not be using the word stealing to talk about what is
otherwise called “copying”. He would not be constructing
elaborate metaphors about crowbars when the more fitting
antiquated device of his comprehension is &lt;strong&gt;a zerox machine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you know what they say: to imprison a political activist who’s 
fighting to preserve the open and decentralized internet, you’ve got
to break a few metaphors. And as is proper, his defenders
are no more restrained in their rhetoric:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress, an activist
    group that Mr. Swartz founded, said in a statement that the
    arrest “makes no sense,” comparing the indictment to “trying to
    put someone in jail for allegedly checking too many books out
    of the library.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m calling B.S on that. It is more like trying to put someone in jail for copying too
many books at the library and using a copier that was &lt;em&gt;for librarians
only&lt;/em&gt;. LOCK ’IM UP!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~~~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a lot of people the incriminating detail in this story is that Swartz
is alleged to have entered a room he wasn’t supposed to be in, to
copy those files &lt;em&gt;even faster&lt;/em&gt;. He was caught on tape holding a
bicycle helmet to cover his face, which is extra naughty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But trespassing is a violation of &lt;strong&gt;different laws altogether&lt;/strong&gt;, laws
they didn’t even bother charging him with—probably because those
misdemeanors would look ridiculous compared to the super-sized
penalties of the trumped up computer crime charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors are playing a bait and switch game in this case, &lt;a href="http://code.technically.us/post/7381180099/the-art-of-surprise"&gt;as
with others&lt;/a&gt;. You’re sold on a seemingly legitimate if
minor crime, but what you get is a dubious criminal prosecution
for electronic crimes carrying hugely disproportionate penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the government chooses who to prosecute, federal contractors
like HBGary may &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/02/black-ops-how-hbgary-wrote-backdoors-and-rootkits-for-the-government.ars/1"&gt;intentionally and repeatedly violate scores of statutes&lt;/a&gt;
without fear of punishment, while common people may be prosecuted at any
time by some guy who thinks a crowbar is exactly like a “computer command”.
Unfortunately it seems the arbitrary application of government power wasn’t permanently curtailed
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta"&gt;800 years ago&lt;/a&gt;: those limits must be reestablished by every generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think Swartz’s real crime was trespassing, then your
disagreement is not with Segal or Demand Progress. It’s with the
federal prosecutors trying to lock him up for everything else.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://code.technically.us/post/7883552030</link><guid>http://code.technically.us/post/7883552030</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2011 09:01:00 -0400</pubDate><category>Computers</category><category>Politics</category><category>Laws</category><category>Information</category><category>Dumb Property</category></item><item><title>Federal Government Indicts Former Demand Progress Executive Director For Downloading Too Many Journal Articles</title><description>&lt;a href="http://demandprogress.org/aaron"&gt;Federal Government Indicts Former Demand Progress Executive Director For Downloading Too Many Journal Articles&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Moments ago, Aaron Swartz, former executive director and founder of Demand Progress, was indicted by the US government. As best as we can tell, he is being charged with allegedly downloading too many scholarly journal articles from the Web. The government contends that downloading said articles is actually felony computer hacking and should be punished with time in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand Progress is a prominent organizer of civil opposition to US government efforts to curtail freedom of information on the internet, including the &lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20029282-281.html"&gt;kill switch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/05/protect-act/"&gt;blacklist&lt;/a&gt; bills. They are political threat to a paranoid, cynical, and technologically ignorant worldview—and nothing else. If a member of their leadership has indeed been arrested on trumped up charges, it is disturbing to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: here’s &lt;a href="http://about.jstor.org/news-events/news/jstor-statement-misuse-incident-and-criminal-case"&gt;what JSTOR says happened&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Last fall and winter, JSTOR experienced a significant misuse of our database. A substantial portion of our publisher partners’ content was downloaded in an unauthorized fashion using the network at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of our participating institutions.  The content taken was systematically downloaded using an approach designed to avoid detection by our monitoring systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s their side of the story. What constitutes “unauthorized” here, and what legal penalties apply for accessing data in a way that was not anticipated remains to be seen. It’s hard to know if this aggressive prosecution is targeted, since aggressive prosecution of anything computer related is the norm. But the laws that enable such disproportionate use of government power are of course exactly the ones Demand Progress organizes democratic opposition to.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://code.technically.us/post/7811368600</link><guid>http://code.technically.us/post/7811368600</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2011 15:05:00 -0400</pubDate><category>US</category><category>Internet Freedom</category><category>Demand Progress</category></item><item><title>Announcing Baitha: The Scala/Android toolkit</title><description>&lt;a href="http://www.deepbluelambda.org/programs/baitha/announcing-baitha--the-scala-android-toolkit"&gt;Announcing Baitha: The Scala/Android toolkit&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://code.technically.us/post/7771612651</link><guid>http://code.technically.us/post/7771612651</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2011 15:53:37 -0400</pubDate><category>Scala</category><category>Android</category><category>Libraries</category></item><item><title>Talking trash, no doubt</title><description>&lt;img src="http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lohwyp2uUj1qb6dplo1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking trash, no doubt&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://code.technically.us/post/7734937157</link><guid>http://code.technically.us/post/7734937157</guid><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2011 16:59:13 -0400</pubDate><category>Scalathon</category></item><item><title>How to preinstall Scala on your (rooted) Android phone</title><description>&lt;a href="http://zegoggl.es/2011/07/how-to-preinstall-scala-on-your-android-phone.html"&gt;How to preinstall Scala on your (rooted) Android phone&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the main problems when developing Scala on Android is the fairly heavy runtime — Scala adds a few megabytes which need to be converted to Dalvik bytecode during the build process (slow!). The common workaround is to use tools like proguard or treeshaker to shrink the code before dexing it.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;However if this is still to slow there is another option which works on rooted devices and the Android emulator: predex the Scala libraries and add them to the Android runtime, on the device itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Android has the concept of a boot classpath (similar to the JVM) which contains all the system framework classes…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you could replace the busted old HttpClient libraries while you’re in there! But then no one else would be able to run your app.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://code.technically.us/post/7730185424</link><guid>http://code.technically.us/post/7730185424</guid><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2011 14:30:58 -0400</pubDate><category>Scala</category><category>Android</category><category>Classpaths</category><category>Hell</category></item><item><title>Brendan McAdams and Pony, learning Scala without really trying</title><description>&lt;img src="http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lohp2trsya1qb6dplo1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brendan McAdams and Pony, learning Scala without really trying&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://code.technically.us/post/7729507257</link><guid>http://code.technically.us/post/7729507257</guid><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2011 14:08:52 -0400</pubDate><category>Scalathon</category><category>Ponies</category></item><item><title>Runar, on missile launching and other side effects</title><description>&lt;img src="http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lohjskclHj1qb6dplo1_500.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Runar, on missile launching and other side effects&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://code.technically.us/post/7726340420</link><guid>http://code.technically.us/post/7726340420</guid><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2011 12:14:43 -0400</pubDate><category>Scalathon</category></item><item><title>Implicits without the import tax, Josh Suereth’s famous NE...</title><description>&lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/20308847" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implicits without the import tax, Josh Suereth’s famous &lt;a href="http://www.nescala.org/2011/"&gt;NE Scala&lt;/a&gt; talk&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://code.technically.us/post/7725809740</link><guid>http://code.technically.us/post/7725809740</guid><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2011 11:53:36 -0400</pubDate><category>Scala</category><category>Implicits</category><category>Scoping</category><category>Types</category></item></channel></rss>
