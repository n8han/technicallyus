      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Has anyone done this with lemons and limes as a main ingredient?  Would need the addition of honey maybe?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I made sorbet this weekend.I used a 1/2 bag of frozen whole strawberries (or use as much as you like).,and three bananas ( frozen )added 1 tablespoon of smuckers all fruit strawberry jam. Put it all in the food processor and processed away. It is so good. I am going to experiment because I love sorbet since I can&amp;#8217;t have ice cream anymore because of the fat content. By the way, does anyone have any sorbet recipes with lavender in it? I would love to have it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Meh&amp;#8212;I found that boiling a whole raw chicken does not give as good of a flavor as using the carcass of a chicken that has already been roasted.  Plus, mine never foamed.  Anyone have any idea why there was no foam?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Love this chicken broth recipe and find it soothing for my soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found a few ways to stretch the meals from it&amp;#8230;amazed at the nourishment from the diversity and number of meals that come from making the broth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for posting this!  &lt;br /&gt;

      <link>http://technically.us/eat/x/the-rice-cooker-i-had-to-have#item-6647</link>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;So the porridge setting is for jook; that would have been useful to know when I had a lot of dental work last year. Right now the only thing I use this cooker for is brown rice, which seems like kind of a waste considering its price and how much counter space it takes up. If I had a smaller house and/or kitchen I would probably sell it on Craig&amp;#8217;s List.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <link>http://technically.us/eat/x/the-rice-cooker-i-had-to-have#item-6646</link>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Yes, porridge, also called juk (jook) is soft, watery rice into which you sprinkle condiments such as salty pickled things, crispy fried things, meat and vegetables, or eat it with fried fish that has had hot oil and soy sauce drizzled over it. It&amp;#8217;s not just for breakfast. I am also searching for the difference between semi-brown and brown rice with not much success. In the meantime, I am going on visual cues such as how much bran is left on the grain&amp;#8212;more bran being more brown.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hi Joanne&amp;#8212;Since you can taste the sauce as you are making it I would start by doubling the salt and mustard, taste, then decide. Just guessing I think you&amp;#8217;ll need the full amount of mustard for the rich flavor but maybe not all the salt.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>On: Martha Stewart's caramel nut bars</title>
      <link>http://technically.us/eat/x/martha-stewarts-caramel-nut-bars#item-6639</link>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hi Rachel-Sorry you had to duplicate my experience. The only mistake I think I might have made may have involved the temperature of the sugar syrup when I added the cream as I am not a veteran of homemade French caramel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the ingredients are expensive and all I can think of doing with your big pan of slop is using it as an ice cream sauce. Either scraping the topping off, or even chopping up the shortbread and using the whole thing; maybe you could layer that with ice cream in pretty glass flutes and put them in the freezer before the dinner party, might make a unique dessert, sort of a &amp;#8220;caramel shortbread fool.&amp;#8221; Which is what we are. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I just made these caramel nut bars and they did not come out. I followed the receipe to a T and still it is runny, I am trying to think of what to use it for, maybe as a center for somethng, any ideas I don&amp;#8217;t want to waste the ingredients, they are expensive.  I wish I would of read this before I made them, I got the recipe from a cook book of cookies and copied it, I did not know it was Martha&amp;#8217;s recipe.  So help me any ideas on what to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lin: Thank you for the nice flame. You might notice that this article was written nearly five years ago. Although TJ&amp;#8217;s doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to have improved at all. Their &amp;#8220;fresh&amp;#8221; items are uniformly lousy, and if you think otherwise then you obviously know nothing about food or cooking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This article is ridiculous.  I have shopped at several Trader Joe&amp;#8217;s stores in different states and they DO have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOTS&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRESH&lt;/span&gt; vegetables that are not all sealed in plastic.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Thx so much for putting this receipe on the web..I took lessons from Jacques in the late 70&amp;#8217;s and 80&amp;#8217;s when I lived in Hollywood FL and he circulated the cooking school circuit including Bon Appetit in Plantation FL  He was great fun to learn from and taught me how to bone a duck in record time. I was in my very early 30&amp;#8217;s then..&lt;br /&gt;
I had the priviledge of attending all the classes he taught and practiced till perfect when I got home. I am still a foodie and people come to me for receipes and restaurant reccomendations.  &lt;br /&gt;
