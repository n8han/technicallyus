  &lt;p&gt;Blocking parallel imports ensures only a select number of vendors can bid, driving up prices. Usually there’s a small sop to American labor, well-publicized in the media with photo-ops of people in hard hats – e.g. the 250 jobs heralded for the Sprinter order – but the bulk of the extra money goes elsewhere. It creates makework for consultants and lobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even if it were more effective. it would have a cost. It is not smart to burden your preferred transportation with extra costs. If you want to advocate for labor, advocate for it universally. Because if railroad operators are burdened with half-baked American liberalism while auto consumers are free to Buy Japan, Buy Korea, and very soon Buy China,  you end up with the epic fail that is Amtrak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, new generations seem determined to make the same mistakes. California’s HSR advocates &lt;a href="http://cahsr.blogspot.com/2008/09/powering-high-speed-train-with.html"&gt;wanted a requirement that their trains receive 100% of their power from renewable sources&lt;/a&gt;. That sounds great, but it’s really very stupid. It is hard enough to actually get HSR built without decimating its potential profitability in order to make it &lt;em&gt;even greener&lt;/em&gt; than it naturally friggin’ is. Go ahead and sign a paper saying that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; energy use must be 100% renewable, if it’s as easy as that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you want your favorite projects to fail and your favorite policies to be discredited along with them, please do not load every possible noble passion into one advocacy basket.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://n8han.technically.us/post/8700258516</link><guid>http://n8han.technically.us/post/8700258516</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2011 15:53:05 -0400</pubDate><category>Trains</category><category>Autos</category><category>Labor</category><category>Energy</category><category>Advocacy</category><category>Alon Levy</category></item><item><title>The future of the Suzy-Q</title><description>&lt;a href="http://capntransit.blogspot.com/2011/08/future-of-suzy-q.html"&gt;The future of the Suzy-Q&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Police brass are now reconsidering changing the penalty to three days for the first offense, five for a second and eight for a third — under a plan devised due to a widening ticket-fixing scandal in the department.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The ticket slowdown has prompted some bosses to threaten to ride along with cops so that they’ll be pressured to issue more tickets, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night on Adams I was stopped at a light next to a crossover SUV, that Nissan or Infiniti trophy model you still see a lot of. After all the pedestrians had crossed, its driver blithely proceeded through red light just as I was planning to do. I shrugged and followed on my bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our roads are over-engineered for speed and under-designed for safety. Our traffic laws mostly protect the strong from the weak and the fast from the slow. But police refuse to enforce them anyway, if they must also enforce them against friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something has got to give.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://n8han.technically.us/post/8690907298</link><guid>http://n8han.technically.us/post/8690907298</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Aug 2011 11:19:05 -0400</pubDate><category>Traffic</category><category>Priorities</category><category>Police</category><category>Corruption</category><category>Autos</category><category>Laws</category><category>NYC</category><category>NYP</category></item><item><title>"In a hilarious development, Governors Cuomo and Christie expect us to believe that they had no idea..."</title><description>“In a hilarious development, Governors Cuomo and Christie expect us to believe that they had no idea the Port Authority would propose such a steep hike.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;PlaneRed is an all-you-can-eat flight subscription launching around September 1st 2011 that will fly just below the TSA’s radar – using 9-person planes to dodge under their screening of any plane carrying over 10 passengers. The subscriptions will work as such – passengers will pay around $150 a month for access to a booking system much like a city bus, able to book on popular routes on the east coast, serving Atlantic City, New York, Philadelphia, Washington D.C.. They hope to expand quickly to Boston, and then open up new runs in Texas, California, and the Midwest. Eyerly sees it as a ‘win-win’ for customers – 14-passenger planes organized in a luxury set-up to make the journey just a little bit more pleasant.

from motorists than all three years of daily riding before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not doing anything differently, at least not by choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temporary closure of the north side of the Manhattan Bridge
to cyclists has &lt;a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2011/07/18/wanted-better-protection-for-thousands-of-cyclists-dumped-onto-the-bowery/"&gt;put me out in the middle of Bowery&lt;/a&gt; a lot more
than I would like to be. That’s where I was told, on Saturday,
to “Get off the fucking street!” by the driver of a worn down
Land Rover who by all appearances was visiting Manhattan island
for weekend entertainment. For what it’s worth, I was on my way
to a work obligation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was among five cyclists trying to ride down an
auto-choked Spring Street when one young woman had an SUV door
opened into her in the most careless fashion. She exchanged some
words with the driver, and it ended with the motorist standing in
the street yelling at all of us, “There’s no bike lane here!”
Then he just repeatedly and manically shouted “bike lane!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only there &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; an eastbound bicycle lane around there, we
would have been on it. Grand Street is grand (when it is not
entirely ripped up by ConEd) but you have to get to it first,
meaning you ride on regular old streets. That would be fine if so
many motorists weren’t dangerously resentful lunatics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then today. There’s the crossing of Houston on Lafayette that
is severely constrained by construction. The only safe way to
navigate the current mess is to enter the intersection as soon as the light 
is green and hold the traffic lane. The bicycle lane is barricaded, after
which it might be open but it’s usually blocked by one or more
vehicles. There’s no point in “weaving” left into it because
after the next light, which is timed to be red at that moment,
the bicycle lane shifts right to where you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve learned to stay in the traffic lane there, and because of
all the circumstances that I unfortunately know so well, there is
no chance that anyone else is adversely affected. If they have to
drive slower, they are driving slower to a red light and merging traffic
at the next street narrowing forced by the construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, this morning after clearing the construction zone safely
and without drama (at least, from where I was—I imagine it was a
slow-motion disaster derby behind me) I was aggressively passed
by a passenger car that then pulled into the bike lane at a red
light to make the same left turn I was making. He wasn’t just
cutting me off, but also a truck which was turning left from the
correct lane. We all three performed that stupid left turn at once, a
potentially deadly (for me) and pointless (for them) ballet. You
can’t make the light at Broadway, no matter who you cut off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as I coolly rode past the truck stuck at that light, what did
he say out his window in a low voice? “I’m gonna run you over.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the context in which trucks are actually &lt;a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2011/08/02/trucker-kills-cyclist-daily-news-are-bikes-more-dangerous-than-cars/"&gt;running people
over&lt;/a&gt;, on a regular basis. It’s socially acceptable to
threaten pedestrians and cyclists with death, both vocally and
physically—and it is socially acceptable to kill them
accidentally. You can’t separate the two; each requires and
supports the other. And whatever is socially acceptable is legally
acceptable, in theory and in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could come up with any number of explanations for the surge
of road rage happening right now. The DOT bears responsibility
for the Bowery detour and the chaos at Houston, but given the
structural violence of our streets there are going to be serious
problems any time that events force cyclists outside of
the few safer routes that have been carved out for us. Until those
structural problems are fixed the DOT can only offer band-aids, as 
they have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the slander against cyclists that has been woven into the death
rattle of old media certainly doesn’t help. But mostly I think
it’s the belated, furious realization of some city motorists that
things really have changed. The “bike lanes!”, formerly hated for
just taking a up a few feet of asphalt, are now &lt;strong&gt;despised for
actually working&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone can see that many more people are riding. And different
kinds of people. It’s not only immigrants with no one to stand up
for them, or rough and tough warrior-cyclists rearing for a fight. It’s
mostly just regular folks, taking their place on the streets they
have paid for through taxes. And this is the real threat to angrily careless 
and violent motorists: that we refuse to engage on their terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t said anything back to the lunatics who’ve been yelling
at me lately. What’s the point? Their words are
self-refusing. What they recognize and fear is that we’re willing and
able to take this fight to the government where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By riding calmly, happily, and respectfully we’re a rolling
demonstration that our streets do not have to be ruled by the amorality of
“might makes right”. Our consideration is not how heavy your vehicle is or
even how loudly you can shout. It’s who you don’t kill, the fuels you
don’t deplete, the space you leave open for others to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our traffic laws must be righted—but, psychologically we’re
already there. My rides of the past week have actually been the
most pleasant yet. For every irate motorist, there’s been a dozen
more cordial cyclists to brighten my day.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://n8han.technically.us/post/8442996666</link><guid>http://n8han.technically.us/post/8442996666</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Aug 2011 17:44:00 -0400</pubDate><category>Cycling</category><category>Autos</category><category>NYC</category><category>Laws</category><category>Priorities</category></item></channel></rss>
